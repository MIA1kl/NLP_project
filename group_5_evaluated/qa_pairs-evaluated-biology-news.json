    "text": "Plant growth is driven by light and supplied with energy through photosynthesis by green leaves. It is the same for roots that grow in the dark\u2014they receive the products of photosynthesis, in particular sucrose (sugar), via the central transportation pathways of phloem.          In their study published in Current Biology, Dr. Stefan Kircher and Prof. Dr. Peter Schopfer from the University of Freiburg's Faculty of Biology have now shown in experiments using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) that the sucrose not only guarantees the supply of carbohydrates to the roots, it also acts as a signal transmitter for the formation of light-dependent root architecture.It does this in two ways: firstly, sucrose directly guides elongation of the primary root. Secondly, the sucrose that is transported to the tip of the root then regulates the production of the plant hormone auxin. This hormone drives the rate of formation of new lateral roots, which\u2014along with elongation of the primary root\u2014is synchronized by the joint signal transmitter.\"This enables the root growth to adapt to the current photosynthesis performance of the leaves as light and other environmental conditions change, for example, on the change from day to night,\" says Kircher.Experimental evidence To demonstrate that the sucrose produced through photosynthesis is the decisive signal transmitter, Kircher and Schopfer placed the plants in a room with light but with no carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air, thus making photosynthesis impossible.The outcome was that no more lateral roots were formed. This result was confirmed by another experiment in which the two biologists treated either the leaves or the roots in the dark with a solution of sucrose. In both approaches, lateral roots developed the same as in control plants that were exposed to light.\"These results show that the production of sucrose in leaves is necessary for the formation of lateral roots. And it confirms the hypothesis that sucrose acts as a signal transmitter for light stimuli,\" says Kircher.Activation of auxin biosynthesis by sucrose signalIn earlier studies, researchers had already shown that the auxin produced in the roots from the amino acid tryptophan drives the rate of development of new lateral roots. Kircher and Schopfer have now shown how sucrose triggers this process.To do this, they placed the plants in a dark room for two days and carried out various experiments to discover their influence on the formation of lateral roots. Administering tryptophan to the roots at the same time as treating the leaves with sucrose had the greatest effect. By contrast, tryptophan had little effect if it was applied to the leaves or without sucrose at the roots.\"These observations confirm that the sucrose produced through photosynthesis serves as a trigger for the synthesis of auxin,\" says Kircher.

    "question_squad": " What percentage of the increase in speed was attributed to genetic improvement?",
    "text": "A new study by experts from the University of Exeter has found that genetic improvement is underlying the increasing speed of Britain's thoroughbreds. This contrasts with earlier studies that suggested racehorses were showing no genetic improvement in response to selection by breeders.       However, the new study has also revealed that rates of genetic progress are relatively low, particularly over long-distance races. Further research is required to determine what is preventing more rapid improvement.The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Heredity, analyzed a data set of 692,534 race times run by more than 76,000 horses born between 1995 and 2012. Over sprint, middle-distance and long-distance races, genetic improvement for thoroughbred speed was found to be ongoing and statistically significant.The study found that genetic improvement accounts for 60%, 55% and 17% of the total increase in speed observed over short, middle and long distances respectively.                Temporal trends in predicted breeding values (PBV) for speed from Model B fitted by MCMC.

Gray lines indicate each of 1000 realizations of the temporal pattern in mean PBV. Credit: Heredity (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41437-023-00623-8             The research also showed that thoroughbred speed is only weakly heritable across all distances\u2014in part explaining the slow rates of genetic improvement.The researchers suggest the low rates of genetic improvement also raise the possibility that selection of racehorses for breeding may be weaker than previously assumed, particularly over long distances, or that some other constraint may be at play.Dr. Patrick Sharman, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus in Cornwall, said, \"There has been plenty of debate over the recent decades whether racehorses have reached a genetic limit to how fast they can run. Our analysis suggests that is not the case, and on the contrary, provides strong statistical evidence that racehorses continue to evolve to run faster in Great Britain. The question now is why are rates relatively low, particularly over long-distances?\"We estimated relatively low heritability for racehorse speed, which goes some way to explaining it, but it would appear there is more to it. The selection of racehorses for breeding may be less accurate and weaker than generally assumed, particularly over long-distance races, but other factors could be constraining genetic improvement.\" More information:Patrick Sharman et al, Genetic improvement of speed across distance categories in thoroughbred racehorses in Great Britain, Heredity (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the enzyme that cleaves proteins?",
    "text": "During the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a long string of connected proteins is cleaved apart into individual proteins. This process is interrupted by an FDA-approved drug to treat COVID-19; however, the mechanistic details of this cleavage process are still unclear. Now, a team led by researchers at Penn State has produced the most detailed images to date of this process, revealing that these proteins are cleaved in a consistent order likely dictated by the structure of the protein string.          The results, published in a paper appearing in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, could support the development of more efficient drugs to treat COVID-19.Retroviruses and many other RNA viruses\u2014including SARS-CoV-2\u2014translate their RNA genomes into a long string of connected proteins called a polyprotein. This polyprotein is later cleaved apart one at a time into individual, mature proteins by an enzyme called a protease.This process is an essential step in virus replication and is thus an ideal target of antiviral drugs. For example, the drug Paxlovid, which has been approved for emergency use to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19, contains a protease inhibitor called nirmatrelvir that interferes with this process in the SARS-CoV-2 virus within infected human cells.\"The SARS-COV-2 virus uses a protease called Mpro to cleave a polyprotein into 10 individual proteins in a specific order,\" said Katsuhiko Murakami, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State and an author of the paper.\"But how this order is determined has remained unclear. Why does Mpro go to one recognition site first over the others? In this study, we used cryo-electron microscopy to produce high-resolution 3D visualizations of Mpro alone and in complex with the polyprotein. Better understanding how this cleavage process occurs could provide insights to optimize the binding of an antiviral drug or even reveal new ways to inhibit the process.\"Previous studies used an imaging technique called X-ray crystallography to investigate Mpro on its own or while it is attached to a very short segment of the polyprotein. However, the research team wanted to study Mpro in context, with a much more representative form of the polyprotein and at a higher resolution.\"A limitation with previous studies was they were using only a small peptide to mimic the polyprotein,\" said Manju Narwal, postdoctoral researcher at Penn State and first author of the paper. \"We wanted a clearer view of how Mpro approaches the various recognition sites on the polyprotein to see if there was something about Mpro or the polyprotein that dictates where it goes first.\"      The researchers found that Mpro associates with the recognition site at the cleavage location but makes very little contact with the rest of the polyprotein. According to the researchers, this suggests that the polyprotein structure may dictate which site Mpro cleaves first.\"If Mpro was driving the process, selecting a preferred recognition site from all of the exposed possibilities, we would expect it to make additional contacts with the polyprotein for reasons related to energetics and stability,\" said Narwal.\"Because we don't see those additional contacts, we suspect that the polyprotein's structure may instead dictate the cleavage order. For example, only a limited number of recognition sites within the polyprotein may be accessible to Mpro. When the first protein is cleaved by Mpro and separates from the rest of the polyprotein, the next preferred site is exposed. Then, once that one is cleaved, it exposes another, and so on.\"These new insights were possible because the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), an imaging technique that produces atomic resolution biomolecular structures.\"Because of the importance of Mpro, researchers from around the world quickly produced hundreds of images of the protease using X-ray crystallography, which is well-suited to investigating structures of smaller targets,\" said Jean-Paul Armache, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State and an author of the paper.\"Cryo-EM is a technique more often applied to larger molecules, but Mpro, even when bound to the polyprotein, is still quite small, which can make it harder to determine the structure at high-resolution. Despite the small size, we were able to focus on Mpro using cryo-EM thanks to a combination of Manju's careful sample preparation; the skill of our cryo-EM microscopist and co-author, Thomas Edwards; and modern data-processing techniques.\"The research team conducted its initial experiments with instruments at the Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences' Cryo-EM Facility and followed up with additional imaging at the National Cancer Institute's National Cryo-EM Facility in Frederick, Maryland.\"Although we determined a clear image of Mpro when bound to the polyprotein, the image of the polyprotein itself was less clear,\" said Murakami. \"We are working to visualize the entire complex and to focus in on other regions of the polyprotein. These insights will support future research on this critical step in the replication of many viruses and, we hope, will ultimately support the creation of efficient new antiviral drugs.\" More information:Manju Narwal et al, SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein substrate regulates the stepwise Mpro cleavage reaction, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the study that found that humans have lost half of the bacterial groups in their guts?",
    "text": "A new study finds that hundreds of bacterial groups have evolved in the guts of primate species over millions of years, but humans have lost close to half of these symbiotic bacteria.          In the study, researchers compared populations of gut bacteria found in chimpanzees and bonobos, our closest relatives, with those of humans\u2014which in total amount to some 10,000 different lineages of bacteria. The scientists analyzed the evolutionary relationships of these bacteria in primates and identified groups of bacteria that were present in distant ancestors of humans and primates. Strikingly, the results showed that these ancestral symbionts are being lost rapidly from the human lineage.Though the cause of these shifts in human gut microbiomes is not known, the study's authors suspect changing diets probably caused the divergence.\"The working idea is that the losses we see spanning all human populations, regardless of lifestyle, were likely driven by dietary shifts that happened early in human evolution since we've diverged from chimpanzees and bonobos,\" said Andrew Moeller, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and faculty curator of mammalogy at the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the paper's senior author.In particular, human diets shifted away from complex plant polysaccharides found in leaves and fruits towards more animal fat and protein, Moeller said.Jon Sanders, a former postdoctoral researcher in Moeller's lab, is first author of the study, \"Widespread Extinctions of Co-diversified Primate Gut Bacterial Symbionts From Humans,\" published May 11 in Nature Microbiology. Daniel Sprockett, a current postdoctoral researcher in Moeller's lab, is also a co-author.In the study, the researchers analyzed metagenomes, which are assembled by piecing together short base pair sequences from a whole community of genomes; the metagenomes revealed which microorganisms were present in a sample and their relative abundances.Analyses of 9,640 human and non-human primate metagenomes, including newly generated ones from chimpanzees and bonobos, revealed significant evidence that gut bacteria groups shared an evolutionary history with their hosts, according to the paper.The results showed that 44% of clades\u2014a group that has evolved from a common ancestor\u2014that have a shared evolutionary history with African apes were absent from the human metagenomic data and 54% were absent from industrialized human populations. At the same time, only 3% of bacterial clades in African apes that did not share an evolutionary history with these hosts were absent in humans.\"This is the first microbiome-wide study showing that there are a great number of ancestral co-diversifying [shared evolution] bacteria that have been co-living within primates and humans for millions of years,\" Moeller said.Still, Moeller highlighted the importance of improved sampling in human populations, especially those outside of industrial countries, in order to fully represent human gut microbiome diversity.Ancestral bacteria may be passed from one generation to another from mothers to babies, and by social transmission with other members of the same species.The discrepancy in extinct bacteria between the general human population and those from industrialized countries may point to differences related to modern diets and medicines, such as antibiotics that are known to alter microbiomes. Some researchers have speculated that the disruption of ancestral flora could be playing a role in modern diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and metabolic syndrome.A second related paper, \"Home-site Advantage for Host Species-specific Gut Microbiota,\" also led by Moeller and Sprockett, which published May 12 in Science Advances, showed that gut bacteria locally adapt to the hosts they live in, providing a possible mechanism for the long-term stability of these symbioses.

    "question_squad": " What did the researchers discover about the current avian flu?",
    "text": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists discovered how the current epizootic H5N1 avian influenza virus (bird flu) gained new genes and greater virulence as it spread west. Researchers showed that the avian virus could severely infect the brains of mammalian research models, a notable departure from previous related strains of the virus.          The researchers genetically traced the virus' expansion across the continent and its establishment in wild waterfowl populations to understand what makes it so different. The study was recently published in Nature Communications.\"We haven't seen a virus quite like this one,\" said corresponding author Richard Webby, Ph.D., St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases. \"In 24 years of tracing this particular H5N1 flu lineage, we haven't seen this ability to cause disease but also be maintained in these wild bird populations.\"When the scientists tested the newer avian flu strains for their ability to cause disease in mammals by infecting a ferret model, they found an unexpectedly high amount of pathogenicity.\"Some of these are really nasty viruses,\" Webby said. \"There's a huge amount of the virus in the brain of infected animals. That's the hallmark of what we saw with these flu strains\u2014increased pathogenicity associated with high virus load in the brain. That's not the first time we've seen H5 viruses in the brain, but these are probably some of the most virulent we've looked at over 24 years of following these viruses.\"Previous influenza viruses that caused severe disease in North America \"burned out\" in their main host bird population, and the outbreaks ended quickly. This current strain was detected at high levels in sick chickens but has expanded into other species.\"This is not just a chicken virus now,\" Webby said. \"It's also infecting other avian and mammal species in the U.S. It's a higher exposure risk for humans and other mammals than we've ever had in North America. We've never really been exposed to this level of circulation of these highly pathogenic flu viruses.\"A low risk to humans (for now)While the newer strains of this H5N1 influenza show a greater ability to cause disease in mammals than earlier viruses, the scientists found it to be low-risk to humans. This is because the virus appears well-adapted to transmit between birds rather than between mammals.\"Overall, their risk to humans is still low,\" Webby said. \"But that risk does seem to be changing, and these viruses are doing things that we haven't seen H5s do before. They've come into the continent's wild bird population, they've reassorted, and they've been maintained over time. There are now many different types out there, and they're very nasty.\"Even though the risk of spreading infection is low, the research suggests humans should be cautious interacting with wildlife.\"Someone would have to work pretty hard to infect themselves with this virus. But if they do happen to be infected, there's a real chance of getting a severe disease from it,\" Webby said. \"People just need to be careful and remember that some of the wild animals out there potentially harbor these highly pathogenic viruses.\"      Genetic change supercharges spread and severityIn the past, similar strains of influenza viruses have not caused similarly severe diseases, nor have they become far-flung in wild bird populations. Since the new strains have done so much more damage, the scientists looked for what was different.The group identified the direct ancestor to the current strains, which spread from Europe to the Americas after gaining a different version of the viral protein, neuraminidase. This new protein increased the virus's ability to transmit between birds. Then it arrived on the East Coast of Canada and traveled to the United States.As the researchers studied the virus further, they pinpointed which viruses\u2014distinct from previous ones \u2014caused the current outbreaks. They found that after reaching North America, the virus rapidly changed again to become more virulent. It mixed with flu viruses in North American wild birds, swapping several genes.This reassortment of genes had two effects. One, the virus seemed to become even more adapted to the bird population, infecting many different types of birds. This included atypical hosts, such as buzzards and eagles, which typically do not get the flu. Second, the virus gained its severe disease-causing properties.\"The surprising thing was that just a few reassortment events did change these viruses' ability to cause disease in our models,\" Webby said. \"And those events generated many different genotypes from that mixing. Then those viruses spread and have now become established in the North American wild bird population.\"Webby's group and others continue to monitor the ongoing avian flu pandemic globally to assess its continually evolving risk to both humans and birds.

    "text": "How do flying insects like important pollinators locate odor sources in the great outdoors, despite encountering highly variable wind conditions? They use odor plumes\u2014which travel like smoke and form when the wind blows odor molecules from their source\u2014to track down sources such as flowers or pheromones.          But wind tunnels are typically unable to replicate realistic outdoor wind conditions. In Physics of Fluids, University of Nevada at Reno researchers decided to explore microscale wind conditions in various outdoor environments to better understand what flying insects might experience while tracking odor plumes.Authors, Jaleesa Houle and Floris Van Breugel, assessed the mechanical turbulence produced by ambient wind flowing over surface roughness elements such as buildings, trees, and fences and its role in odor plume tracking.\"Since we're studying wind dynamics within the surface roughness sublayer, most known atmospheric similarity theories that describe properties of the wind profile are not applicable,\" said Houle. \"So, we use statistical analysis to find both spatial and temporally significant correlations between wind measurements for various sites where we collected data.\"They collected near-surface wind data from several sage steppe (shrub-filled grassland), forest, and urban areas in Northern Nevada and discovered near-surface wind direction is often highly variable over timescales of less than 10 minutes. They also found wind direction variability to be consistently higher in environments with greater surface complexity (urban areas) and lower at higher wind speeds.\"This is important because insects are typically tracking odor plumes in lower wind speeds, which indicates they are somehow making sense of the high directional variability they encounter,\" said Houle. \"Turbulence intensity is strongly correlated with standard deviations in wind direction, which might be useful for future wind tunnel experimental designs aimed at recreating more 'natural' winds.\"Based on their findings, Houle and van Breugel hypothesize an optimal range of wind speed and environmental surface complexity may exist to help insects locate an odor source.\"Further experiments will be needed to test our hypothesis and may help us better understand the implications of land fragmentation on the success of ecologically significant plume tracking insects, such as pollinators,\" said Houle. \"Beyond this, our results give a compelling reason for researchers to focus on increasing directional variability in wind tunnel studies if they want to uncover plume tracking behaviors that more closely resemble what we might see in nature.\"Next, the researchers will apply their findings to plume tracking wind tunnel experiments and a series of outdoor studies.\"During the summer, we plan to test our hypothesis regarding the types of wind conditions insects might prefer while tracking odor plumes,\" said Houle. \"In the lab, we're actively looking for ways to create greater directional variability to better mimic natural wind.\"The article, \"Near-surface wind variability over spatiotemporal scales relevant to plume tracking insects,\" is authored by Jaleesa Houle and Floris Van Breugel, and published in Physics of Fluids May 30, 2023.

    "text": "Cell culture is a vital technology used in pharmaceutical production and regenerative medicine. It is heavily influenced by the composition of the medium, a nutrient-rich solution facilitating cell growth. Optimizing and developing culture media is a critical task in various sectors, including food, pharmaceuticals, bioenergy, and materials.       However, as the culture media varies according to cell type, creating a specific medium for each purpose demands substantial time and labor. Therefore, more efficient techniques for culture medium development are needed. A study, recently published in the journal npj Systems Biology and Applications, uses artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, to develop high-performance culture media, reducing the associated labor.A total of 232 media, containing 31 different nutrients, were used to culture cells derived from human cervical cancer. The experimental data obtained was then subjected to machine learning to predict superior medium compositions that would yield a higher cellular activity. Active learning was used to enhance prediction accuracy.As a result, a culture medium was developed that promoted higher cell activity than the commercial medium. Moreover, the optimized compositions for the early and late stages of cell culture were found to differ, and the decision-making components were identified.These results demonstrate the practicality of efficiently optimizing medium compositions using artificial intelligence. The methodology used in this study can be applied to develop culture media for various cell lines and culture purposes. This considerably contributes to a broad spectrum of industrial and academic research that uses cell culture as a foundational technology.

    "text": "Plant growth is driven by light and supplied with energy through photosynthesis by green leaves. It is the same for roots that grow in the dark\u2014they receive the products of photosynthesis, in particular sucrose (sugar), via the central transportation pathways of phloem.          In their study published in Current Biology, Dr. Stefan Kircher and Prof. Dr. Peter Schopfer from the University of Freiburg's Faculty of Biology have now shown in experiments using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) that the sucrose not only guarantees the supply of carbohydrates to the roots, it also acts as a signal transmitter for the formation of light-dependent root architecture.It does this in two ways: firstly, sucrose directly guides elongation of the primary root. Secondly, the sucrose that is transported to the tip of the root then regulates the production of the plant hormone auxin. This hormone drives the rate of formation of new lateral roots, which\u2014along with elongation of the primary root\u2014is synchronized by the joint signal transmitter.\"This enables the root growth to adapt to the current photosynthesis performance of the leaves as light and other environmental conditions change, for example, on the change from day to night,\" says Kircher.Experimental evidence To demonstrate that the sucrose produced through photosynthesis is the decisive signal transmitter, Kircher and Schopfer placed the plants in a room with light but with no carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air, thus making photosynthesis impossible.The outcome was that no more lateral roots were formed. This result was confirmed by another experiment in which the two biologists treated either the leaves or the roots in the dark with a solution of sucrose. In both approaches, lateral roots developed the same as in control plants that were exposed to light.\"These results show that the production of sucrose in leaves is necessary for the formation of lateral roots. And it confirms the hypothesis that sucrose acts as a signal transmitter for light stimuli,\" says Kircher.Activation of auxin biosynthesis by sucrose signalIn earlier studies, researchers had already shown that the auxin produced in the roots from the amino acid tryptophan drives the rate of development of new lateral roots. Kircher and Schopfer have now shown how sucrose triggers this process.To do this, they placed the plants in a dark room for two days and carried out various experiments to discover their influence on the formation of lateral roots. Administering tryptophan to the roots at the same time as treating the leaves with sucrose had the greatest effect. By contrast, tryptophan had little effect if it was applied to the leaves or without sucrose at the roots.\"These observations confirm that the sucrose produced through photosynthesis serves as a trigger for the synthesis of auxin,\" says Kircher.

    "question_squad": " What percentage of the increase in speed was attributed to genetic improvement?",
    "text": "A new study by experts from the University of Exeter has found that genetic improvement is underlying the increasing speed of Britain's thoroughbreds. This contrasts with earlier studies that suggested racehorses were showing no genetic improvement in response to selection by breeders.       However, the new study has also revealed that rates of genetic progress are relatively low, particularly over long-distance races. Further research is required to determine what is preventing more rapid improvement.The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Heredity, analyzed a data set of 692,534 race times run by more than 76,000 horses born between 1995 and 2012. Over sprint, middle-distance and long-distance races, genetic improvement for thoroughbred speed was found to be ongoing and statistically significant.The study found that genetic improvement accounts for 60%, 55% and 17% of the total increase in speed observed over short, middle and long distances respectively.                Temporal trends in predicted breeding values (PBV) for speed from Model B fitted by MCMC.

Our analysis suggests that is not the case, and on the contrary, provides strong statistical evidence that racehorses continue to evolve to run faster in Great Britain. The question now is why are rates relatively low, particularly over long-distances?\"We estimated relatively low heritability for racehorse speed, which goes some way to explaining it, but it would appear there is more to it. The selection of racehorses for breeding may be less accurate and weaker than generally assumed, particularly over long-distance races, but other factors could be constraining genetic improvement.\" More information:Patrick Sharman et al, Genetic improvement of speed across distance categories in thoroughbred racehorses in Great Britain, Heredity (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the enzyme that cleaves proteins?",
    "text": "During the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a long string of connected proteins is cleaved apart into individual proteins. This process is interrupted by an FDA-approved drug to treat COVID-19; however, the mechanistic details of this cleavage process are still unclear. Now, a team led by researchers at Penn State has produced the most detailed images to date of this process, revealing that these proteins are cleaved in a consistent order likely dictated by the structure of the protein string.          The results, published in a paper appearing in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, could support the development of more efficient drugs to treat COVID-19.Retroviruses and many other RNA viruses\u2014including SARS-CoV-2\u2014translate their RNA genomes into a long string of connected proteins called a polyprotein. This polyprotein is later cleaved apart one at a time into individual, mature proteins by an enzyme called a protease.This process is an essential step in virus replication and is thus an ideal target of antiviral drugs. For example, the drug Paxlovid, which has been approved for emergency use to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19, contains a protease inhibitor called nirmatrelvir that interferes with this process in the SARS-CoV-2 virus within infected human cells.\"The SARS-COV-2 virus uses a protease called Mpro to cleave a polyprotein into 10 individual proteins in a specific order,\" said Katsuhiko Murakami, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State and an author of the paper.\"But how this order is determined has remained unclear. Why does Mpro go to one recognition site first over the others? In this study, we used cryo-electron microscopy to produce high-resolution 3D visualizations of Mpro alone and in complex with the polyprotein. Better understanding how this cleavage process occurs could provide insights to optimize the binding of an antiviral drug or even reveal new ways to inhibit the process.\"Previous studies used an imaging technique called X-ray crystallography to investigate Mpro on its own or while it is attached to a very short segment of the polyprotein. However, the research team wanted to study Mpro in context, with a much more representative form of the polyprotein and at a higher resolution.\"A limitation with previous studies was they were using only a small peptide to mimic the polyprotein,\" said Manju Narwal, postdoctoral researcher at Penn State and first author of the paper. \"We wanted a clearer view of how Mpro approaches the various recognition sites on the polyprotein to see if there was something about Mpro or the polyprotein that dictates where it goes first.\"      The researchers found that Mpro associates with the recognition site at the cleavage location but makes very little contact with the rest of the polyprotein. According to the researchers, this suggests that the polyprotein structure may dictate which site Mpro cleaves first.\"If Mpro was driving the process, selecting a preferred recognition site from all of the exposed possibilities, we would expect it to make additional contacts with the polyprotein for reasons related to energetics and stability,\" said Narwal.\"Because we don't see those additional contacts, we suspect that the polyprotein's structure may instead dictate the cleavage order. For example, only a limited number of recognition sites within the polyprotein may be accessible to Mpro. When the first protein is cleaved by Mpro and separates from the rest of the polyprotein, the next preferred site is exposed. Then, once that one is cleaved, it exposes another, and so on.\"These new insights were possible because the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), an imaging technique that produces atomic resolution biomolecular structures.\"Because of the importance of Mpro, researchers from around the world quickly produced hundreds of images of the protease using X-ray crystallography, which is well-suited to investigating structures of smaller targets,\" said Jean-Paul Armache, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State and an author of the paper.\"Cryo-EM is a technique more often applied to larger molecules, but Mpro, even when bound to the polyprotein, is still quite small, which can make it harder to determine the structure at high-resolution. Despite the small size, we were able to focus on Mpro using cryo-EM thanks to a combination of Manju's careful sample preparation; the skill of our cryo-EM microscopist and co-author, Thomas Edwards; and modern data-processing techniques.\"The research team conducted its initial experiments with instruments at the Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences' Cryo-EM Facility and followed up with additional imaging at the National Cancer Institute's National Cryo-EM Facility in Frederick, Maryland.\"Although we determined a clear image of Mpro when bound to the polyprotein, the image of the polyprotein itself was less clear,\" said Murakami. \"We are working to visualize the entire complex and to focus in on other regions of the polyprotein. These insights will support future research on this critical step in the replication of many viruses and, we hope, will ultimately support the creation of efficient new antiviral drugs.\" More information:Manju Narwal et al, SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein substrate regulates the stepwise Mpro cleavage reaction, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the study that found that humans have lost half of the bacterial groups in their guts?",
    "text": "A new study finds that hundreds of bacterial groups have evolved in the guts of primate species over millions of years, but humans have lost close to half of these symbiotic bacteria.          In the study, researchers compared populations of gut bacteria found in chimpanzees and bonobos, our closest relatives, with those of humans\u2014which in total amount to some 10,000 different lineages of bacteria. The scientists analyzed the evolutionary relationships of these bacteria in primates and identified groups of bacteria that were present in distant ancestors of humans and primates. Strikingly, the results showed that these ancestral symbionts are being lost rapidly from the human lineage.Though the cause of these shifts in human gut microbiomes is not known, the study's authors suspect changing diets probably caused the divergence.\"The working idea is that the losses we see spanning all human populations, regardless of lifestyle, were likely driven by dietary shifts that happened early in human evolution since we've diverged from chimpanzees and bonobos,\" said Andrew Moeller, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and faculty curator of mammalogy at the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the paper's senior author.In particular, human diets shifted away from complex plant polysaccharides found in leaves and fruits towards more animal fat and protein, Moeller said.Jon Sanders, a former postdoctoral researcher in Moeller's lab, is first author of the study, \"Widespread Extinctions of Co-diversified Primate Gut Bacterial Symbionts From Humans,\" published May 11 in Nature Microbiology. Daniel Sprockett, a current postdoctoral researcher in Moeller's lab, is also a co-author.In the study, the researchers analyzed metagenomes, which are assembled by piecing together short base pair sequences from a whole community of genomes; the metagenomes revealed which microorganisms were present in a sample and their relative abundances.Analyses of 9,640 human and non-human primate metagenomes, including newly generated ones from chimpanzees and bonobos, revealed significant evidence that gut bacteria groups shared an evolutionary history with their hosts, according to the paper.The results showed that 44% of clades\u2014a group that has evolved from a common ancestor\u2014that have a shared evolutionary history with African apes were absent from the human metagenomic data and 54% were absent from industrialized human populations. At the same time, only 3% of bacterial clades in African apes that did not share an evolutionary history with these hosts were absent in humans.\"This is the first microbiome-wide study showing that there are a great number of ancestral co-diversifying [shared evolution] bacteria that have been co-living within primates and humans for millions of years,\" Moeller said.Still, Moeller highlighted the importance of improved sampling in human populations, especially those outside of industrial countries, in order to fully represent human gut microbiome diversity.Ancestral bacteria may be passed from one generation to another from mothers to babies, and by social transmission with other members of the same species.The discrepancy in extinct bacteria between the general human population and those from industrialized countries may point to differences related to modern diets and medicines, such as antibiotics that are known to alter microbiomes. Some researchers have speculated that the disruption of ancestral flora could be playing a role in modern diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and metabolic syndrome.A second related paper, \"Home-site Advantage for Host Species-specific Gut Microbiota,\" also led by Moeller and Sprockett, which published May 12 in Science Advances, showed that gut bacteria locally adapt to the hosts they live in, providing a possible mechanism for the long-term stability of these symbioses.

    "text": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists discovered how the current epizootic H5N1 avian influenza virus (bird flu) gained new genes and greater virulence as it spread west. Researchers showed that the avian virus could severely infect the brains of mammalian research models, a notable departure from previous related strains of the virus.          The researchers genetically traced the virus' expansion across the continent and its establishment in wild waterfowl populations to understand what makes it so different. The study was recently published in Nature Communications.\"We haven't seen a virus quite like this one,\" said corresponding author Richard Webby, Ph.D., St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases. \"In 24 years of tracing this particular H5N1 flu lineage, we haven't seen this ability to cause disease but also be maintained in these wild bird populations.\"When the scientists tested the newer avian flu strains for their ability to cause disease in mammals by infecting a ferret model, they found an unexpectedly high amount of pathogenicity.\"Some of these are really nasty viruses,\" Webby said. \"There's a huge amount of the virus in the brain of infected animals.

That's not the first time we've seen H5 viruses in the brain, but these are probably some of the most virulent we've looked at over 24 years of following these viruses.\"Previous influenza viruses that caused severe disease in North America \"burned out\" in their main host bird population, and the outbreaks ended quickly. This current strain was detected at high levels in sick chickens but has expanded into other species.\"This is not just a chicken virus now,\" Webby said. \"It's also infecting other avian and mammal species in the U.S. It's a higher exposure risk for humans and other mammals than we've ever had in North America. We've never really been exposed to this level of circulation of these highly pathogenic flu viruses.\"A low risk to humans (for now)While the newer strains of this H5N1 influenza show a greater ability to cause disease in mammals than earlier viruses, the scientists found it to be low-risk to humans. This is because the virus appears well-adapted to transmit between birds rather than between mammals.\"Overall, their risk to humans is still low,\" Webby said. \"But that risk does seem to be changing, and these viruses are doing things that we haven't seen H5s do before. They've come into the continent's wild bird population, they've reassorted, and they've been maintained over time. There are now many different types out there, and they're very nasty.\"Even though the risk of spreading infection is low, the research suggests humans should be cautious interacting with wildlife.\"Someone would have to work pretty hard to infect themselves with this virus. But if they do happen to be infected, there's a real chance of getting a severe disease from it,\" Webby said. \"People just need to be careful and remember that some of the wild animals out there potentially harbor these highly pathogenic viruses.\"      Genetic change supercharges spread and severityIn the past, similar strains of influenza viruses have not caused similarly severe diseases, nor have they become far-flung in wild bird populations. Since the new strains have done so much more damage, the scientists looked for what was different.The group identified the direct ancestor to the current strains, which spread from Europe to the Americas after gaining a different version of the viral protein, neuraminidase. This new protein increased the virus's ability to transmit between birds. Then it arrived on the East Coast of Canada and traveled to the United States.As the researchers studied the virus further, they pinpointed which viruses\u2014distinct from previous ones \u2014caused the current outbreaks. They found that after reaching North America, the virus rapidly changed again to become more virulent. It mixed with flu viruses in North American wild birds, swapping several genes.This reassortment of genes had two effects. One, the virus seemed to become even more adapted to the bird population, infecting many different types of birds. This included atypical hosts, such as buzzards and eagles, which typically do not get the flu. Second, the virus gained its severe disease-causing properties.\"The surprising thing was that just a few reassortment events did change these viruses' ability to cause disease in our models,\" Webby said. \"And those events generated many different genotypes from that mixing. Then those viruses spread and have now become established in the North American wild bird population.\"Webby's group and others continue to monitor the ongoing avian flu pandemic globally to assess its continually evolving risk to both humans and birds.

    "text": "How do flying insects like important pollinators locate odor sources in the great outdoors, despite encountering highly variable wind conditions? They use odor plumes\u2014which travel like smoke and form when the wind blows odor molecules from their source\u2014to track down sources such as flowers or pheromones.          But wind tunnels are typically unable to replicate realistic outdoor wind conditions. In Physics of Fluids, University of Nevada at Reno researchers decided to explore microscale wind conditions in various outdoor environments to better understand what flying insects might experience while tracking odor plumes.Authors, Jaleesa Houle and Floris Van Breugel, assessed the mechanical turbulence produced by ambient wind flowing over surface roughness elements such as buildings, trees, and fences and its role in odor plume tracking.\"Since we're studying wind dynamics within the surface roughness sublayer, most known atmospheric similarity theories that describe properties of the wind profile are not applicable,\" said Houle. \"So, we use statistical analysis to find both spatial and temporally significant correlations between wind measurements for various sites where we collected data.\"They collected near-surface wind data from several sage steppe (shrub-filled grassland), forest, and urban areas in Northern Nevada and discovered near-surface wind direction is often highly variable over timescales of less than 10 minutes. They also found wind direction variability to be consistently higher in environments with greater surface complexity (urban areas) and lower at higher wind speeds.\"This is important because insects are typically tracking odor plumes in lower wind speeds, which indicates they are somehow making sense of the high directional variability they encounter,\" said Houle. \"Turbulence intensity is strongly correlated with standard deviations in wind direction, which might be useful for future wind tunnel experimental designs aimed at recreating more 'natural' winds.\"Based on their findings, Houle and van Breugel hypothesize an optimal range of wind speed and environmental surface complexity may exist to help insects locate an odor source.\"Further experiments will be needed to test our hypothesis and may help us better understand the implications of land fragmentation on the success of ecologically significant plume tracking insects, such as pollinators,\" said Houle. \"Beyond this, our results give a compelling reason for researchers to focus on increasing directional variability in wind tunnel studies if they want to uncover plume tracking behaviors that more closely resemble what we might see in nature.\"Next, the researchers will apply their findings to plume tracking wind tunnel experiments and a series of outdoor studies.\"During the summer, we plan to test our hypothesis regarding the types of wind conditions insects might prefer while tracking odor plumes,\" said Houle. \"In the lab, we're actively looking for ways to create greater directional variability to better mimic natural wind.\"The article, \"Near-surface wind variability over spatiotemporal scales relevant to plume tracking insects,\" is authored by Jaleesa Houle and Floris Van Breugel, and published in Physics of Fluids May 30, 2023.

    "text": "Cell culture is a vital technology used in pharmaceutical production and regenerative medicine. It is heavily influenced by the composition of the medium, a nutrient-rich solution facilitating cell growth. Optimizing and developing culture media is a critical task in various sectors, including food, pharmaceuticals, bioenergy, and materials.       However, as the culture media varies according to cell type, creating a specific medium for each purpose demands substantial time and labor. Therefore, more efficient techniques for culture medium development are needed. A study, recently published in the journal npj Systems Biology and Applications, uses artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, to develop high-performance culture media, reducing the associated labor.A total of 232 media, containing 31 different nutrients, were used to culture cells derived from human cervical cancer. The experimental data obtained was then subjected to machine learning to predict superior medium compositions that would yield a higher cellular activity. Active learning was used to enhance prediction accuracy.As a result, a culture medium was developed that promoted higher cell activity than the commercial medium. Moreover, the optimized compositions for the early and late stages of cell culture were found to differ, and the decision-making components were identified.These results demonstrate the practicality of efficiently optimizing medium compositions using artificial intelligence. The methodology used in this study can be applied to develop culture media for various cell lines and culture purposes. This considerably contributes to a broad spectrum of industrial and academic research that uses cell culture as a foundational technology.

    "text": "Senckenberg researchers have introduced a new invasion biology concept, so-called \"nested invasions.\" Using Johnstone's whistling frog as an example, they show that this amphibian not only colonizes foreign regions, but it also carries invasive microbiomes in its baggage. The scientists thereby provide the first comprehensive dataset for an invasive community and warn of the still unknown impact on the newly colonized ecosystems.          Animals carry trillions of bacteria, viruses, archaeans, and fungi in their digestive tracts and on their skin. These internal ecosystems help them obtain nutrients, fight pathogens, and develop their immune systems.\"Such 'microbiomes' are also found in amphibians; their skin, which is moist due to their dermal respiration, is particularly predestined for this,\" explains PD Dr. Raffael Ernst from the Senckenberg Natural History Collections in Dresden, and he continues, \"We are interested in how these microbiomes of alien species affect native ecosystems and what role they play in the successful colonization by the immigrants.\"To investigate this question, Ernst, along with first author and doctoral student Franziska Leonhardt and researchers from Munich and Stuttgart, took a close look at Johnstone's whistling frog (Eleutherodactylus johnstonei). The frog, which measures only about 17 to 35 millimeters and is originally native to the Lesser Antilles, is a highly successful invasive animal that has spread throughout the Caribbean and much of mainland Central and South America and can now also be found in botanical gardens across Europe.\"We genetically analyzed the skin and intestinal microbiomes of Eleutherodactylus johnstonei from native populations in St. Lucia and immigrant populations in Guadeloupe, Colombia, and from European greenhouses. Our results show that amphibian-associated and microbial environmental communities can be considered 'metacommunities' that interact with each other. These interactions with the environment play a greater role in the skin microbiome than in that of the gut,\" Leonhardt explains.                After the skin swab, the frogs are released again. Credit: Franziska Leonhardt             High levels of bacteria can spread between frogs and the environment, according to the study. The researchers suggest that greater attention should be paid to the spread of microbiota by alien species in order to prevent the propagation of vector-borne pathogens as well as non-pathogenic microbes.\"Community ecology concepts are at the heart of a holistic understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms of biological invasions. This is especially true when assessing the complex and diverse microbiota associated with each invasive species. To date, traditional studies have largely failed to account for these nested immigrations, and thus have ignored a potentially important aspect of invasion processes. However, we can summarize by saying that alien species do not arrive alone! Our approach can complement and broaden the traditional perspective on biological invasions\u2014not least to provide improved conservation measures in the future,\" concludes Ernst.The paper is published in the journal Microbial Ecology.

    "text": "Wild dingo populations have less dog lineage, with a significantly greater proportion of pure dingoes than previously thought, according to new research, challenging the view that pure dingoes are on the decline due to crossbreeding.          The findings, published in Molecular Ecology, suggest previous studies significantly overestimated the prevalence of dingo-dog mixes in the wild and that lethal methods to control 'wild dogs' target pure dingoes.Dingoes are genetically distinct from domestic dogs but can interbreed. Cross-species breeding, or hybridization, can threaten pure species, which may become vulnerable to extinction by genetic dilution.\"For decades, there was fear that dingoes were breeding themselves into extinction. But our findings suggest this isn't the case, and dingoes are largely maintaining their identity, which has implications for their management and conservation,\" says Dr. Kylie Cairns, a conservation biologist from UNSW Science and lead author of the study.More pure dingoes than hybridsFor the study, the research team led by UNSW Sydney investigated the extent of dingo hybridization in different regions across Australia. They used a new genome-wide test to analyze the DNA of 391 wild and captive dingoes and conducted detailed ancestry modeling and biogeographic analysis to find wild dingoes had far less dog ancestry than suggested by prior genetic studies.\"The old method, which relied on a relatively small number of genetic markers and limited reference population, overestimates the amount of dog ancestry in dingo samples\u2014sometimes by over 30%,\" Dr. Cairns says. \"This meant it often identified an animal as crossbred when it was a pure dingo or historical backcross.\"\"But with the new test, we can look at 195,000 points across the genome compared with just 23 previously. So, it's a huge step up in reliability and accuracy.\"In Victoria, where previous reports suggested the pure dingo population was as small as 4%, the study found 87.1% of animals tested were pure dingoes and 6.5% were historical dingo backcrosses with more than 93% dingo ancestry.Similarly, in New South Wales and Queensland, where dingo-dog hybridization is assumed to be pervasive, most animals were found to be pure dingoes, and only two wild canids had less than 70% dingo ancestry.                Previous DNA testing methods overestimated the amount of dog ancestry in dingoes. Credit: Shutterstock             Little evidence of hybridization in the dingo population was also found in the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia.\"Reliance on outdated DNA testing methods has led to the belief that dingo\u2013dog hybridization is much more common in Australia than it really is,\" Dr. Cairns says. \"Most dingoes in the wild are pure dingoes, and the remaining animals are more dingo than anything else.\"\"Even in the parts of Australia where dingo-dog hybridization is higher, it is not the pervasive threat we've been led to believe.\"No animals in the sample were 50% hybrids\u2014meaning none were direct offspring of a dog and a dingo in the wild. The few animals that weren't pure dingoes were mostly historical backcrosses with a single dog ancestor four or five generations in the past.\"While there has been some hybridization in the past, it's not occurring at a rapid pace today,\" Dr. Cairns says. \"Where it does happen, we can see the offspring of the hybrids returning to their dingo roots over time.\"The study also found significant regional variation in dingoes, with four distinct wild dingo populations across mainland Australia.\"We didn't have samples from every single corner of Australia. So, there may be even more variation in dingoes,\" Dr. Cairns says. \"There's also a chance some dog DNA has been integrated into the dingo genome because it's provided an evolutionary advantage, so that's something we plan to investigate in future research using the new testing.\"The findings are consistent with studies in other species demonstrating genome-wide analysis performs more accurate identification of ancestry, which policymakers can use to inform dingo management.\"Existing management decisions have been based on the findings from old DNA testing technology with limited resolution,\" says Professor Mike Letnic, a conservation biologist from UNSW Science and senior author of the study. \"We now have a more advanced approach using higher-density genomic data that can be applied to dingoes to assess populations more accurately and inform management strategies with best-available evidence.\"                The research also found there are four wild dingo varieties, with captive dingoes forming their own population. Credit: Shutterstock             Informing evidence-based dingo managementIn Australia, the term \"wild dog\" is widely used in policy under the assumption there is widespread dingo\u2013dog hybridization and very few remaining pure dingoes.Under the name \"wild dog,\" dingoes, dingo-hybrids, and feral domestic dogs are all considered invasive species under biosecurity legislation and subject to eradication measures like aerial baiting or trapping across parts of the Australian mainland, including National Parks where native animals are protected.\"It's convenient to paint all dingoes as wild dogs. But the term obscures the reality that many pure dingoes and dingo-dominant backcrosses are being killed,\" Dr. Cairns says. \"In fact, no other native species is treated in quite the same way as the dingo, which is subject to lethal control measures across all landscapes, including ones where they should be protected.\"Environments without dingoes can get overrun by kangaroos, foxes and feral cats that threaten other native animals and can change vegetation significantly.\"Dingoes are a threat to some livestock, but they're not a pest in all contexts. They play a crucial role as apex predators in maintaining ecosystem function and biodiversity,\" Prof. Letnic says. \"So, there's a real need find a balance in management and ensure there are places in the landscape where we maintain populations.\"Lethal control methods, particularly during dingo breeding season, may inadvertently increase the risk of hybridization by reducing the availability of pure dingo mates. However, more research is needed to confirm the link.\"While we don't have many hybrids running around like previously suggested, where dingo-dog hybridization does occur, it's in regions where intensive lethal control is used and where there are higher numbers of domestic pet dogs,\" Dr. Cairns says.The researchers suggest that the definition of \"dingoes\" in conservation policy should be revised to include historical dingo backcrosses with 93% or more dingo ancestry and distinguish them from \"feral domestic dogs.\"\"Doing so will more accurately reflect the identity of wild canids in Australia and acknowledge the value of dingoes as a native and culturally significant species,\" Dr. Cairns says.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the organelles that help rRNA molecules travel down to the basal side?",
    "text": "The early stages of embryonic development contain many of life's mysteries. Unlocking these mysteries can help us better understand early development and birth defects, and help develop new regenerative medicine treatments.          Researchers based at the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute (ARMI) at Monash University have characterized a critical time in mammalian embryonic development using powerful and innovative imaging techniques, with their work published in Nature Communications.\"Just a few days into the journey of embryogenesis, when turning into 16 cells, the embryo must make its first difficult decision\u2014which of its cells will give rise to the embryo or will become extra-embryonic tissue, for example, placenta,\" explained lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Zenker.In this study, the research team has discovered how this decision-making process is facilitated by capturing the inner organization of single cells of the early embryo.\"Ribonucleic acid, RNA, plays a key role here. At the 16-cell stage, the different subtypes of RNA, named rRNAs, mRNAs and tRNAs, are sorted to the two ends of a cell called apical and basal side. The distribution of RNA subtypes determines what the next generation of cells of the embryo will become,\" Dr. Zenker said.Interestingly, while most mRNAs and tRNAs remain parked at the apical side, most rRNA molecules travel down to the basal side hitchhiking on organelles called lysosomes. Even though retaining less overall RNA content, the apical sides of outer 16-cell stage cells contain the full collection of RNAs and other factors required for protein production.The crowded basal side, however, is occupied predominantly with rRNAs. Daughter cells obtaining the more active protein factories of the apical side, are more transformable and specialize into the future placenta. The daughter cells which retain their potential to still become any type of cell of the adult organism, called pluripotency, receive the less translationally active bulk of rRNA.This decision and many like it, which is known as cell fate, are important in development as it determines how these early cells reach their final cell type, such as skin cells, heart muscle cells and brain cells. For regenerative medicine, being able to orchestrate cell fate opens up the capacity to generate new stem cell-based treatments for a number of diseases and conditions.\"As in real life, cells can influence the direction of their own future by getting organized early. Our research may open new ways to predict and direct cell fate decisions,\" Dr. Zenker said.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the seagrass that has replaced eelgrass as the dominant seagrass in Chesapeake Bay?",
    "text": "Mangroves are growing in areas historically dominated by salt marshes and oyster reefs. Invasive pacific oysters are replacing native blue mussels in the Wadden Sea. Macroalgae are exhibiting dominance over hard corals in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific. Climate change-driven shifts in dominant, habitat-forming species such as these can have significant implications for conservation, and this is a phenomenon that seems to be particularly prevalent for seagrass systems around the world.          In research published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, VIMS researchers and their collaborators evaluate the causes and consequences of a new dominant seagrass species rising in the Chesapeake Bay, demonstrating both new threats and management opportunities.For this study, the authors combined 38 years of data on nutrient and sediment pollution from runoff, temperature, plankton blooms, and river flow with aerial seagrass surveys to describe the causes and consequences of shifting seagrass foundation species across 26,000 hectares of habitat in Chesapeake Bay.Demonstrated shifts in seagrass create faster recovery but larger die-offs across Chesapeake BayMarine heatwaves and poor water clarity in Chesapeake Bay over the last few decades have cut the area occupied by the previously dominant seagrass, eelgrass, in half. At the same time, successfully implemented nutrient reductions throughout the bay have encouraged the rapid expansion of another seagrass, the cosmopolitan widgeongrass.Confined to a fringing area of shallow brackish waters until the mid 1990s, widgeongrass has now replaced eelgrass as the most abundant seagrass in Chesapeake Bay by expanding over 150% due to both high temperature-tolerance and long-lasting seeds that allow for rapid recovery after disturbance.\"Widgeongrass' recovery and expansion ability is so strong,\" explains lead author Hensel, \"that ideal widgeongrass conditions have fueled two record-setting peaks for Chesapeake Bay seagrass cover. In fact, much of the nearly 300% increase in Bay plants since the mid 1990s has been widgeongrass expansion into areas that eelgrass has vacated.\"However, some negative consequences from the shift have concerned habitat managers.\"We've seen periods of rapid widgeongrass expansion and retraction for decades now, far beyond what we've documented for eelgrass,\" says Landry, co-author and leader of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Workgroup.\"But now that widgeongrass has become so widespread in the bay, its fluctuating abundance can have a big impact on our overall acreage trends and on our Bay-wide restoration goal attainment. That's the management concern. The ecological concern is the impact those fluctuations are having on the animals that have grown to depend on widgeongrass for habitat in the absence of eelgrass.\"The causes of these fluctuations have been difficult to understand because widgeongrass and eelgrass appear to respond differently to climate change and nutrient pollution stressors.                Eelgrass (blue) extent has decreased over the last 40 years, especially as the mean summer temperature (light red) in the lower Chesapeake Bay has risen enough to frequently exceed eelgrass' ~25 \u00b0C mean summer temperature limit (light red shaded horizontal line). With both eelgrass' habitat loss and successful Bay-wide nutrient reductions that increased water clarity, the area covered by temperature tolerant widgeongrass (green) greatly expanded. Widgeongrass temperature maxima are not reached in Chesapeake Bay. Credit: Dr. Marc Hensel             Yet when the authors examined long-term, large-scale data on climate stressors and watershed pollution from agriculture and development in tandem with year-to-year aerial survey imagery of seagrass meadows, they recognized an important shift in the dominant climate stressor for Chesapeake Bay seagrass: while widgeongrass is resistant to heatwaves and high temperatures, it is highly vulnerable to periods in spring when high rains can bring huge influxes of nutrient- and sediment-loaded water into the bay, reducing water clarity.\"This study is an important step forward in building our knowledge of human-ecosystem interactions along the coast and how they are changing over time,\" says author Lefcheck.\"Our past work showed a record-setting resurgence of underwater grasses in response to nutrient management, but now we are seeing that the story is vastly more complex and in fact, is still being written. Understanding, adapting to, and communicating this shifting narrative is a challenge, but not an insurmountable one by any stretch.\"      Conserving species with different needs simultaneously is necessary, complexThe team's modeling contributes to a greater understanding of both human and climate drivers of annual changes in widgeongrass and highlights a crucial difference in management compared to an eelgrass-dominated bay.\"Heatwave stress is uncontrollable on a local and regional level,\" explains Patrick, Director of the SAV Monitoring Program at VIMS, \"but managing the amount of nutrients that enter the bay from the watershed during a rainy spring is something that we can actually control.\"This study underscores that, because species differ in their traits and stressor sensitivities, managing for conservation of living habitats requires more community- or species-focused research, monitoring, and actions under climate change. Climate change is shifting the landscape of species composition, creating new winners in these novel environments, and management needs to shift alongside them.Detailed monitoring data allow agencies to focus on each species and encourages them to manage for community or individual habitat requirements, adapting strategies as species composition changes. This study also demonstrates pitfalls that can occur if habitat forming species are lumped together into single \"stocks,\" such as \"hectares of seagrass\" or \"acres of marsh.\"In fact, differences between the seagrass species in this study explain many of the shifts in Chesapeake Bay seagrass meadow dynamics. \"Widgeongrass has shorter, thinner blades than eelgrass,\" says Hensel, \"which makes it more vulnerable to springtime run-off events because sunlight can't reach the short blades through the clouded, nutrient-loaded water. Also, widgeongrass' shallower root system may not sequester carbon as well and its tendency to wildly fluctuate in cover means that it may not provide consistent habitat for key seagrass-dependent species like Blue Crabs and Black Sea Bass.\"The authors call for a parallel shift in coastal monitoring and evaluation of management successes and failures, using the Chesapeake Bay as an example. They cite the necessity of long-term monitoring programs with coordinated and standardized on-the-ground and detail-oriented surveys, as well as the importance of community or species-specific recovery goals across coastlines where multiple seagrass species co-occur and respond to climate differently.\"This is a compelling example of the how climate change is unfolding across the globe,\" said Patrick. \"As regional climates shift, the emergence of novel ecosystems is fundamentally challenging everything we think we know from analysis of historical data. The rules governing the dynamics of the world's ecosystems are changing and we need to step up our monitoring efforts, assess changes in real time, and adapt our strategies along the way.\"\"What worked 10 years ago may not apply five years in the future, or even today. This example defies conventional wisdom that climate change winners will be novel species migrating north and invading into new habitat. At least in the short term, local species that were always present may step up and redefine their role in ecological communities.\"\"With a more complete understanding of climate-driven changes in seagrass species, policymakers and practitioners are better equipped to make evidence-informed decisions about short- and long-term conservation strategies in coastal ecosystems. This specific study focuses on about 100 square miles in the Chesapeake Bay, but its implications extend far beyond the Bay, to seagrass ecosystems in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Atlantic, and Pacific.\" More information:Hensel, Marc J.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the team that conducted the research while at Queen's University?",
    "text": "A new study has shown that humans may have evolved a spring-like arch to help us walk on two feet. Researchers studying the evolution of bipedal walking have long assumed that the raised arch of the foot helps us walk by acting as a lever which propels the body forward.          But a global team of scientists have now found that the recoil of the flexible arch repositions the ankle upright for more effective walking. The effects in running are greater, which suggests that the ability to run efficiently could have been a selective pressure for a flexible arch that made walking more efficient too. This discovery could even help doctors improve treatments for present-day patients' foot problems.\"We thought originally that the spring-like arch helped to lift the body into the next step,\" said Dr. Lauren Welte, first author of the study in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, who conducted the research while at Queen's University and is now affiliated with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"It turns out that instead, the spring-like arch recoils to help the ankle lift the body.\"Step by stepThe evolution of our feet, including the raised medial arch which sets us apart from great apes, is crucial to bipedal walking. The arch is thought to give hominins more leverage when walking upright: the mechanism is unclear, but when arch motion is restricted, running demands more energy. Arch recoil could potentially make us more efficient runners by propelling the center mass of the body forward, or by making up for mechanical work that muscles would otherwise have to do.To investigate these hypotheses, the team selected seven participants with varying arch mobility, who walked and ran while their feet were being filmed by high-speed X-ray motion capture cameras. The height of each participant's arch was measured, and their right feet were CT-scanned.The scientists created rigid models and compared them to the measured motion of the foot bones to test the effect of arch mobility on adjacent joints. They also measured which joints contributed the most to arch recoil, and the contribution of arch recoil to center of mass and ankle propulsion.Leaning into bipedalismAlthough the scientists expected to find that arch recoil helped the rigid lever of the arch to lift the body up, they discovered that a rigid arch without recoil either caused the foot to leave the ground early, likely decreasing the efficiency of the calf muscles, or leaned the ankle bones too far forward.The forward lean mirrors the posture of walking chimpanzees, rather than the upright stance characteristic of human gait. The flexible arch helped reposition the ankle upright, which allows the leg to push off the ground more effectively. This effect is even greater when running, suggesting that efficient running may have been an evolutionary pressure in favor of the flexible arch.The scientists also found that the joint between two bones in the medial arch, the navicular and the medial cuneiform, is crucial to the arch's flexibility. Changes to this joint could help us track the development of bipedalism in the hominin fossil record.\"The mobility of our feet seems to allow us to walk and run upright instead of either crouching forward or pushing off into the next step too soon,\" said Dr. Michael Rainbow of Queen's University, senior author.Therapeutic potentialThese findings also suggest therapeutic avenues for people whose arches are rigid due to injury or illness: supporting the flexibility of the arch could improve overall mobility.\"Our work suggests that allowing the arch to move during propulsion makes movement more efficient,\" said Welte. \"If we restrict arch motion, it's likely that there are corresponding changes in how the other joints function.\"\"At this stage, our hypothesis requires further testing because we need to verify that differences in foot mobility across the population lead to the kinds of changes we see in our limited sample,\" said Rainbow. \"That said, our work sets the stage for an exciting new avenue of investigation.\" More information:Michael Rainbow et al, Mobility of the human foot's medial arch enables upright bipedal locomotion, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology (2023).

    "text": "A research group led by Dr. Naoya Kase and Prof. Megumu Saito have successfully established a model to evaluate skeletal muscle regeneration efficiency and determine how macrophages contribute to the process by using a simple culture method that does not rely on special cell culture conditions. The results of this study were published online in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology on May 18, 2023.       Muscle tissue has a high capacity to regenerate after injury. Macrophages, a type of immune cell, play a critical role in muscle regeneration, but the detailed mechanism by which they contribute to muscle regeneration is not fully understood.The research group created a simple model by culturing mouse primary muscle cells in a dish. The group found macrophages in the culture before and after muscle injury and that they contributed to muscle regeneration. Furthermore, the group observed macrophages pre-treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a macrophage-activating molecule, had a lower capacity to help muscle regenerate due to increased extracellular matrix production.Together, the researchers developed a new model to study the interactions between skeletal muscle cells and macrophages and assess how muscle regeneration may be affected. By identifying the mechanism by which macrophages contribute to muscle regeneration, it will be of tremendous interest to examine how this may change in various muscular pathologies. Moreover, these findings suggest macrophages could be a viable therapeutic target for muscle disorders and injuries.

    "question_squad": " What is the world's largest mistletoe?",
    "text": "Noongar Country of southwestern Australia is home to the world's largest parasitic plant, a mighty mistletoe that blooms every December. That's why it's commonly known as WA's Christmas Tree. But it also goes by other names, mungee and moodjar. And it holds great significance for Noongar people including the Merningar people of the south coast.          While the unique biology and charisma of the species (Nuytsia floribunda) has been recognized by Traditional Owners for millennia, such rich Indigenous knowledge is barely known to Western science. Our research team includes three generations of Merningar alongside non-Indigenous scientists. In our new research, we set out to explore mungee's physiology, ecology and evolution from both Indigenous and Western science perspectives.The plant's ability to access a wide array of resources is remarkable, enabling it to prosper in the hostile, infertile, but biologically rich landscapes of southwestern Australia. This is also the case for Noongar people, whose traditional diet reflects the biological richness of their Country.Mungee is a revered teacher to Noongar people, with lessons for us all about living sustainably and in harmony with one another.A sand-loving parasite Nuytsia floribunda is widespread across Noongar Country (Boodja) and known to most Noongar as moodjar. But it's also called mungee by Merningar and other southern Noongar groups. Being mostly Merningar, we call it mungee and use that term here.Mungee is a mistletoe tree that grows up to 10m tall in sandy soils. It's endemic to southwestern Australia, but widespread throughout. The parasitic capability of the plant comes from highly modified, ring-shaped roots (haustoria) that act like secateurs to mine other plants for water and nutrients.We used \"two way science\" (cross-cultural ecology) methods\u2014including a literature review, shared recording of visits on Country, and an author workshop\u2014to investigate mungee more thoroughly than would be possible through Western science alone.A revered teacher offering divine guidance Like other Indigenous Australian knowledge systems, Merningar lore is place-based. It inextricably links people, specific places, other organisms and non-living entities of Country. Mungee tells specific stories through where it lives, the plants it lives with, and when it flowers.The species is widely held as sacred among Noongar peoples. For Merningar, it has the highest status of all plants. Mungee holds important lore about how we as humans relate to each other and with the world around us, similar to a cornerstone religious text such as the Christian Bible.For Merningar, mungee is a powerful medium that helps restless spirits move on to the afterlife, known to us as Kuuranup. This enables those of us still living to be untroubled by their presence.Senior elder Lynette describes mungee as her teacher, providing guidance on how to exist in Merningar Boodja. The annual summer flowers represent her ancestors returning to their Country, reminding her to cherish and respect both her old people and her Boodja.Lynette calls the ring-shaped haustoria of mungee her \"bush lolly\". Under Merningar lore, digging for these sweet treats is not allowed when mungee is flowering. This is when bush lollies are scarce, so the rule is about living within seasonal constraints.      An example of living sustainably Mungee primarily reproduces by cloning, sending out suckers up to 100m from the parent plant to produce identical copies. This results in patches of mungee clones gathered together in tight-knit populations.We saw parallels between patches of mungee and the communal kinship structures of Noongar society, where family is more important than individuals.Before European settlement, extended Noongar families lived in largely separate groups, interconnected with other family groups as part of a wider geopolitical system. We see mungee as a botanical exemplar of putting community before individuals, for the greater good.Mungee accesses water and nutrients by tapping into a wide range of host plants. This diversity of hosts enables mungee to live in many different landscapes. This parallels with the sophisticated, but often place-specific knowledge of Noongar peoples across their botanically rich Boodja, which has enabled use of a wide range of traditional plants.Living a prosperous life within environmental boundaries is achieved by conservatively drawing upon a wide range of resources. It provides a lesson for all who live in dry and infertile regions such as southwestern Australia.A tree to be celebrated Mungee's bright orange flowers bring joy to all who witness their display during the celebratory summer months in southwestern Australia. The plant's unique biology, ingenuity and charisma has long been recognized by Noongar peoples and their lore.Prolific annual flowers are a memorial to the many old people who have cared for their Boodja through millennia. They also remind us to protect the old peoples' legacy.To Merningar, mungee is a valuable teacher and exemplar of prosperous biological (including human) existence in the southwest Australian global biodiversity hotspot. It has much to teach the rest of us, too. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "question_squad": " What is the goal of the community cat program?",
    "text": "Stray cats are a longstanding problem in Australian towns and cities. Common complaints about roaming cats include nuisance (fighting and urinating), disease risks to humans and other animals, and predation of native wildlife. The huge numbers of cats and kittens taken in by animal shelters and council pounds are a challenge to manage, leading to an estimated 50,000 being killed each year\u2014most of them young and healthy.          Our newly published research reveals Australian council pounds, rescue groups and animal welfare shelters took in 179,615 cats and kittens in 2018-2019. Of these animals, 5% were reclaimed by owners, 65% rehomed and 28% killed.Council-operated pounds killed 46% of all cats and kittens admitted. Shelters killed 25%. One in four council pounds in New South Wales and Victoria killed a staggering 67-100%.Despite the scale of this killing, Australia's stray cat numbers are not decreasing. The evidence shows an urgent need for proactive community cat programs offering free desexing of cats in targeted problem areas.Killing so many cats is bad for people tooHigh cat-killing rates also have a significant human cost. Many council, shelter and veterinary staff suffer devastating psychological impacts when required to kill large numbers of healthy cats and kittens, often repeatedly. These impacts include trauma, depression, substance abuse and increased suicide risk.Members of the public can also be traumatized when the stray cats they are feeding are trapped and killed.Current approaches are failingTo make matters worse, trapping and killing stray cats and kittens is costly and has not worked. This reactive approach has not reduced the stray cat population over the decades it has been applied. Therefore, the potential nuisance, disease risks and native wildlife predation have not been reduced.Our research shows cat intakes actually increased at municipal pounds in NSW from 2016-17 to 2018-19 (pre-COVID data are most accurate). Attempts to adopt and kill our way out of the stray cat problem have failed.Australian councils are increasingly adopting mandatory cat containment (curfews). It seems like a logical solution, but based on the evidence it is not effective. It doesn't reduce stray cat numbers in the short or long term, as shown by the experience of councils such as Casey and Yarra Ranges in Victoria.RSPCA Australia acknowledges:\"Overall, councils with cat containment regulations have not been able to demonstrate any measurable reduction in cat complaints or cats wandering at large.\"In contrast, Hume, Hobsons Bay and Merri-bek councils in Victoria have rejected mandatory containment. Their decisions cited reasons such as it is ineffective and unenforceable because most stray cats don't have an owner to contain them.Cats may be owned, semi-owned (people feed them intentionally) or (uncommonly) unowned. In the latter case they get food unintentionally provided by people, such as from bins.Even for owned cats, containment is sometimes not achievable due to factors such as housing limitations, cost\u2014containment systems typically cost $700-$2,000\u2014and concerns about the welfare of confined cats. Mandatory containment creates a barrier to semi-owners adopting the stray cat they are feeding and also potentially criminalizes cat ownership for disadvantaged families, particularly those in rental properties.Containment to their owners' properties should be strongly encouraged where cats' physical and mental needs can be met. But mandatory containment should be rejected. It will not protect native wildlife, the commonly cited justification, because it does not measurably reduce the number of free-roaming cats.      Stray cats are not feral catsBased on RSPCA and government definitions, stray cats in urban and urban fringe areas are all domestic cats.They are not feral cats. Feral cats live and breed in the wild, not in cities or towns or near people, are not the subject of nuisance complaints and are not admitted to shelters or pounds. Stray cats are sometimes mislabelled as feral cats, which prevents effective solutions to the stray cat problem.Stray cats account for 80-100% of admissions to council pounds and 60-80% to animal welfare agencies. The rest are mostly cats given up by their owners.Most stray cats entering pounds and shelters are from poorer areas and are likely semi-owned cats. The people who feed them do not see themselves as owners of the stray cat but have an emotional bond with the cat.So what's the long-term solution?Assisting semi-owners and owners in disadvantaged areas to desex their cats is the best long-term solution to the stray cat problem. The Community Cat Program is an evidence-based approach that supports cat owners and semi-owners with free desexing and microchipping of the cats they are caring for. These efforts should be focused on areas of high cat intakes and complaints.Proactive community cat programs are scientifically proven to reduce the number of stray cats and unwanted kittens in targeted areas. They thereby reduce nuisance complaints, cat intake and killing, trauma to people, costs, disease risks and wildlife predation.Banyule in Victoria set up a free program to desex, microchip and register owned and semi-owned cats, with a focus on suburbs with high cat-related calls. In just three years, the council reduced impoundments by 61% and numbers killed by 74%. In contrast, after Yarra Ranges Council implemented mandatory containment in 2017, there was a 68% increase in impoundments in the third year.The 2022 NSW Rehoming Practices Review recommended community cat programs, consistent with a \"One Welfare\" approach. The aim is to optimize and balance the well-being of people, animals and their social and physical environment. Earlier this year, the NSW government announced $8.3 million in funding for community cat programs and facilities.At least 50% of cats entering pounds and shelters are kittens less than six months old. These figures highlight why community cat programs are urgently needed across Australia to protect cats, native wildlife and people.

    "text": "Insects are crucial for biodiversity and among the most successful species on the planet. However, until now, it has been unclear how they could exploit such a diversity of food sources. According to a recent study published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, bacteria have played a crucial role.          \"Insect diets range from human blood, in the case of mosquitoes, to the wood used to build our houses, in the case of termites. The common denominator is bacteria. Our findings show that bacteria play a crucial role in providing insects with the nutrients they need to survive and thrive,\" says Charlie Cornwallis, biology researcher at Lund University.The study, which included Weevils, shows that bacteria consistently provide insects with vitamin B, a vital nutrient they cannot make themselves. Insects have become so dependent on bacteria that they have developed new organelles to house them\u2014so called bacteria factories.\"The nutrients provided by bacteria have enabled insects to survive on highly unbalanced diets and exploit new types of food resources. Some insects, such as aphids, solely feed on phloem, essentially sugary water. Imagine being able to lead a healthy life only on sweets!\" says Charlie Cornwallis.However, the effects of bacteria on insect diversity and variation are not straightforward. In certain insect families, specialization on specific diets involving blood has halted species diversification. But in most cases, such as plant-feeding insects, dietary specialization is linked to a significant increase in species.\"Insects are all around us and influence our every walk of life. They spread diseases and even threaten food production as crop pests. Knowing how and why insects survive and diversify is important for understanding the evolution of the natural world and its influence on our own well-being,\" says Charlie Cornwallis.

    "text": "Researchers have shed light on the activity patterns and behavioral adaptations of two sympatric sloth species, Bradypus variegatus and Choloepus hoffmanni. This study, conducted in the lowland rainforests of the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, offers valuable insights into the ecological dynamics of sloths and their ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.          Faced with the challenge of studying the elusive nature of sloths, Dr. Rebecca Cliffe Founder and Executive Director of The Sloth Conservation Foundation and colleagues employed micro data loggers to continuously monitor the behavior of both three-toed sloths (Bradypus) and two-toed sloths (Choloepus) over extended periods, ranging from days to weeks. By doing so, they were able to explore the influence of fluctuating environmental conditions on sloth activity and its correlation with their unique low-energy lifestyle.The findings, published in PeerJ, indicate that both Bradypus and Choloepus sloths exhibit cathemeral activity patterns, characterized by irregular and variable periods of activity throughout the 24-hour cycle. This behavior allows sloths to take advantage of favorable environmental conditions while minimizing the risk of predation.One of the key revelations of the study was the substantial variability observed in activity levels both between individuals and within individuals. This flexibility suggests that sloths have developed diverse strategies to adapt to their surroundings, enhancing their chances of survival in the face of environmental fluctuations.Contrary to expectations, daily temperature did not significantly influence sloth activity. However, Bradypus sloths exhibited increased nocturnal activity on colder nights and the nights following colder days, indicating a potential correlation between temperature variations and their behavior.Dr. Cliffe, the lead scientist on the project, emphasized the importance of this research for conservation efforts and understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change on tropical ecosystems in South and Central America. With the vulnerability of these ecosystems on the rise, unraveling the behavioral ecology of wild sloths becomes crucial for developing effective conservation measures.The cryptic nature of sloths has traditionally made long-term observational research challenging. However, the use of micro data loggers has provided unprecedented insights into their behavioral patterns and adaptations. This breakthrough paves the way for further studies and encourages the scientific community to explore the behavioral ecology of other elusive species with innovative approaches.The results of this study not only contribute to our understanding of sloth ecology but also highlight the importance of preserving and protecting tropical rainforests and their unique inhabitants. As the global climate changes and human activities continue to impact these fragile ecosystems, the knowledge gained from this research will aid in the development of strategies to safeguard their biodiversity and promote sustainable practices.

    "text": "Vegetation phenology, the cycle sequence of the vital activities, is a highly sensitive indicator of the climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Most recent studies focus on the structural changes in plants, such as using the growth process of leaves represented by the greenness indicators. However, these indices work well for capturing the variations in chlorophyll content or structural changes but are less sensitive to physiological changes in vegetation photosynthesis.       Researchers from the Wuhan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed a method combining a smoothing filter and change-point detection to retrieve photosynthetic phenology from a recently developed satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)-based gross primary productivity (GPP) product (GOSIF-GPP: 2001\u20132020) with a 0.05\u00b0 spatial resolution. This study, published in Scientific Data, is titled \"Vegetation photosynthetic phenology dataset in northern terrestrial ecosystems.\"Several phenological metrics were considered, including the state-transition dates of photosynthesis (SOS), the end state-transition dates of photosynthesis (EOS), and the duration length of photosynthesis for terrestrial ecosystems above 30\u00b0 N latitude (northern biomes, including forests, shrublands, savannas, grasslands, wetlands and croplands).The dataset includes single-season and double-growing season phenology time, and the corresponding thresholds extracted at 10%, 25% and 50%. Each data is compared to other vegetation indices or GPP data and validated using the flux dataset.This phenology product allows us to capture multiple photosynthetic activities of vegetation and helps to monitor the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.

    "text": "Seagrass, a group of aquatic angiosperms, grows in shallow waters in the coastal sea and contributes most of the primary production while participating in many important ecological processes. Heat stress threatens the survival of seagrass, but its damage mechanisms are unclear.          Recently, a research team led by Prof. Liu Jianguo from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) primarily explained the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying the decline of tropical seagrass meadows caused by heat stress combined with high light at different functional levels.The study was published in Marine Pollution Bulletin.During the lowest tide, intertidal seagrass is frequently faced with the combined stress of exposure to air, direct sunlight, and high temperature, which may have a strongly negative impact on the survival of seagrass, especially in the context of global warming.The researchers found that the largest tropical seagrass Enhalus acoroides can withstand heat below 39\u00b0C in the dark. However, under high light, the tolerance to heat stress is greatly reduced. The combined effect of short-term exposure to heat and high light stress destroyed the photosystem II (PSII) and destroyed key components of the photosynthetic system in seagrass leaves.Moreover, high light combined with heat stress caused severe oxidative stress in the seagrass, which led to irreversible damage to the seagrass.These results clearly suggest that heat stress coupled with high light, may be an important cause for the decline of E. acoroides meadows.\"Our study reveals that ocean warming, especially when coupled with high light, exacerbates the decline of seagrass meadows and affects the ecological function of intertidal seagrass meadows,\" said Dr. Zhang Mengjie, first author of the study.\"This serves as a warning that the effects of global warming on seagrass meadows will be even worse than expected,\" said Prof. Liu, corresponding author of the study.

    "text": "Conservation efforts for the rare Sierra Nevada red fox can be strengthened through new computer modeling based on a 12-year data gathering partnership led by scientists at Oregon State University's Institute for Natural Resources, says a researcher who helped direct the project.          The endangered fox lives at high elevation in California's Sierra Nevada and Oregon's Cascade Range. Its numbers have been falling for two centuries largely because of human activity including trapping and poisoning, and a warming climate may be making the problem worse, OSU wildlife ecologist Sean Matthews said.\"Low genetic diversity from inbreeding, hybridization with non-native red foxes, and influences of climate change threaten the persistence of the subspecies across its range,\" said Matthews, who co-led the study published in the Journal of Mammalogy. \"Our results provide a demonstration for studying elusive species with limited survey data, a guide for future survey efforts and a baseline to inform conservation and management action.\"Researchers including scientists at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the University of California, Davis, and Yosemite National Park modeled the potential distribution and abundance of the Sierra Nevada red fox throughout its historical and contemporary ranges.Sierra Nevada red foxes, known scientifically as Vulpes vulpes necator, live in a mix of habitats above and below timberline, Matthews said, including meadows, mature forests, talus slopes and fell fields\u2014rock-strewn open areas higher than the tree line.\"The Sierra Nevada red fox experienced large population declines over the last 100 years,\" he said. \"There are historical records of red foxes around Mount Shasta and in the Klamath Mountains, areas now devoid of red foxes. Our limited understanding of the fox's ecology has hindered the development of informed conservation actions.\"The study team, which also included scientists at the U.S. Forest Service, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and the Cascades Carnivore Project, was able to estimate the distribution and population sizes of Sierra Nevada red foxes by using data collected via remotely triggered cameras and other survey tools.The survey period was 2009 through 2020. The modeling approach predicted fox density based on the relationship between detection frequencies and environmental characteristics, allowing for the model to project those densities onto unsampled areas with similar land and vegetation features.      \"That's important because it's not really possible to sample every individual remote area the Sierra Nevada red fox might be living,\" Matthews said.                Sierra Nevada red fox. Credit: National Park Service             Generally, he said, foxes were detected in areas with high amounts of snow and low minimum temperatures; the Sierra Nevada red fox has several adaptations for living in snowy areas, including a thick winter coat and small toe pads covered in dense fur. Foxes were most likely to be detected by a camera in open areas and on gentle slopes.\"We identified areas occupied by Sierra Nevada red fox at very low densities\u2014just over one fox per 100 square kilometers\u2014in the Oregon Cascades, the central Sierra Nevada and around Lassen Peak,\" Matthews said. \"They naturally occur at low densities, but now that they occupy smaller portions of their historical range, there are very few foxes in these areas, which can lead to negative genetic consequences.\"A conservation objective, he said, would be increasing connectivity between fox population areas. That could come in the form of land use decisions that limit habitat fragmentation when projects like highway expansion, recreational development and housing subdivisions are planned.Other actions that could benefit the Sierra Nevada red fox include lowering vehicle speed limits, building wildlife crossing infrastructure and reintroducing foxes in some areas to increase populations and genetic diversity, Matthews said.

Dr. Linda Hern\u00e1ndez Duran from James Cook University's Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine led a study that examined the venom produced by different species of funnel-web under different conditions. The study is published in the journal PLOS ONE.She said funnel-webs are the most venomous spiders in the world. \"Funnel-webs have the most complex venoms in the natural world, and they are valued for the therapeutics and natural bioinsecticides that are potentially hidden in their venom molecules. Knowing more about how they are produced is a step towards unlocking this potential,\" said Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez Duran.The team collected four different species of funnel-web\u2014the Border Ranges (Hadronyche valida), Darling Downs, (Hadronyche infensa), Southern tree-dwelling (Hadronyche cerberea) and Sydney funnel-web (Atrax robustus)\u2014and subjected them to different tests, such as being prodded with tweezers and puffed with air.\"We mapped their behavior and measured their heart rate with a laser monitor to establish a proxy value for their metabolic rate. We then collected their venom and analyzed it with a mass spectrometer,\" said Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez Duran.She said researchers found that certain spiders had variations in their venom based on different factors such as defensiveness and heart rate.\"With the Border Ranges funnel-web, the expression of some venom components was associated with heart rate and defensiveness. The other species didn't demonstrate this, suggesting that particular associations may be species-specific,\" said Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez Duran.She said the use of venom and the display of aggressive behaviors by spiders have metabolic costs.\"As a result, spiders might use different behavioral strategies to compensate for these costs. Our results suggest spiders might increase their metabolic rate when they use venoms, and reduce their movement when facing a threat,\" said Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez Duran.She said the findings highlight the link between behavior, physiology, and venom composition in funnel-webs.\"We showed for the first time how specific venom components are associated with particular behavioral and physiological variables and demonstrated that these relationships are context-dependent.

Scientists studying the critters have now discovered a startling new consequence of climate change: as temperatures rise, females of the species have been gradually advancing the date they re-emerge, now a full 10 days earlier than a quarter century ago.On the other hand, males are not ending their deep sleep sooner: a fact that could soon spell trouble for \"date nights,\" according to a paper published Thursday in the journal Science.Males previously terminated hibernation a month before females, allowing enough time for their testicles, which shrivel up every fall, to regrow and descend, in an annual cycle of puberty. But this interval is narrowing.\"If this continues, we expect to start to see females emerging ready to mate with males before those males are actually fully reproductively mature,\" senior author Cory Williams, a biologist at Colorado State University, told AFP.Unique adaptationsLike many Arctic animals, ground squirrels have evolved to have unique adaptations to the extreme winter.They hibernate around eight months of the year, digging about three feet (a meter) deep in the sandy banks of rivers, just above the tundra's permafrost.                A juvenile arctic ground squirrel foraging near Toolik Field Station in northern Alaska; Scientists studying the critters have now discovered that as temperatures rise, females of the species have been gradually advancing the date they re-emerge.             During this time, their body temperatures drop from about 99 degrees F (37 degrees C) to almost 27F (-3C), the lowest in any mammals, drastically slowing their brain, lungs, heart and other organ functions, in a state called \"torpor.\"The team behind the study were able to harness long-term air and soil temperature data at two sites, and fused those with data collected from biologgers, which measured abdominal and skin temperatures of 199 ground squirrels over the same period.They detected a significant increase in ambient temperature, as expected for a region known to be warming from climate change at a rate four times greater than the global average.\"The minimum soil temperatures in winter are warmer. It's not getting as cold,\" said Williams. \"And then we also saw a change in the freeze-thaw cycle of the soil. So the soils are now freezing later, and they're thawing earlier.\"This had two effects on the animals.Though they entered hibernation at the same time, the point at which their core body temperature fell below 32F (0C) was delayed, which in turn pushed back the date at which they need to generate heat to prevent tissue death during torpor, an energy-intensive process.Second, females ended hibernation earlier, matching the earlier spring thaw.Exactly why this second effect impacts females only isn't confirmed, but the scientists have some theories.                A juvenile arctic ground squirrel foraging near Toolik Field Station in northern Alaska.             For males, rising testosterone levels as they prepare to breed in spring appear to force an end to hibernation at a fixed point, but females seem more responsive to environmental conditions.\"We've found that females will sometimes end hibernation, and then they'll go to the surface and assess conditions, and they'll go back down and re-enter hibernation when there's what we assume is too much snowpack,\" said Williams.      Fatter, but more exposed to predatorsThe advantage of this reduced hibernation was that females emerged with more mass, and could get a head start on foraging for roots, shoots, berries and seeds. This in turn could produce healthier litters and better survival rates.On the other hand, they are exposed for a longer period to their predators\u2014golden eagles, gyrfalcons, foxes and wolves\u2014in addition to the looming disruption in sexual interactions.There could also be cascading impacts up the food chain, if the squirrels' predators adapt to earlier prey availability by advancing their own breeding season.It's too soon to say, then, what the overall impacts might be.But what is striking is the concrete proof of climate directly impacting an ecosystem over a relatively short period of time, said first author Helen Chmura, a US Department of Agriculture Forest Service researcher.\"We have a 25-year-dataset, which is a fairly long term thing for science but that's a short period of time in ecology,\" she told AFP. \"We have evidence of effects on ecosystems within the time span of people's lives, including young people.\" More information:Helen E.

    "text": "Saber Zouani lost his job as a waiter when the COVID pandemic ravaged the Tunisian tourism sector, so he decided to try something new and started a permaculture farm.          Now he grows all the food he needs and has become a pioneer of the style of ecological agriculture that is gaining fans worldwide, including in his North African country.Many hope it will help Tunisia weather the impacts of climate change and wean it off its reliance on global supply chains, including grain and fertilizer imports from war-torn Ukraine and Russia.In his western home town of Cap Negro, Zouani, 37, proudly showed off his three-hectare (seven-acre) farm, set up to mimic natural ecosystems in line with ideas popularized in the 1970s by Australian ecologists.Permaculture, as an alternative to industrial agriculture, aims to work in harmony with the environment, keep soil structures intact, and do without artificial inputs such as chemical fertilizers or pesticides.\"No, these are not weeds,\" said Zouani, a biotechnology graduate, pointing to nettles and dandelions growing wild all around his rows of onions, peppers and radishes.When he harvests his vegetables, he said, he puts the excess green matter back onto the soil to slow evaporation\u2014hoping to keep the ground as moist as a forest floor covered with fallen leaves.                Permaculture aims to work in harmony with the environment, keep soil structures intact and do without artificial inputs like chemical fertilisers or pesticides.             'Create living soil'Such methods are especially useful in Tunisia where an unprecedented drought has parched the countryside and left water reservoirs at dangerously low levels this spring.At his farm, Zouani captures precious rainwater in a pond and only sparingly waters his plants, which are all grown from his own seeds.Zouani also keeps cows, sheep, goats and chickens and composts their droppings to create soil enriched with the nitrogen-rich natural fertilizer.\"We need to create living soil, attract earthworms, fungi and all the nutrients for our plants and trees,\" said Zouani.Permaculture, he said, draws on farming methods and wisdoms of centuries past\u2014\"returning to our roots, to the traditional methods used by our grandparents\".Zouani said he earns around 300 dinars ($100) a month from selling farm produce, with enough left over to make him, his brother and their elderly parents self-sufficient.                Planet-friendly farming like permaculture is especially useful in Tunisia where an unprecedented drought has parched the countryside and left water reservoirs at dangerously low levels.             In two or three years, he hopes to make \"a decent income\" and turn his farm, named \"Om Hnia\" in honor of his late grandmother, into an eatery and eventually a rural eco-lodge.Zouani started off more than two years ago with the help of the Tunisian Association of Permaculture, which gave him initial training and then financial support for basic equipment.The group's \"Plant Your Farm\" project aims to create 50 micro-farms over five years, of which around 30 are already up and running, said its president Rim Mathlouthi.      'Bring back biodiversity'The goal, Mathlouthi said, is to \"demonstrate to the authorities and other farmers that permaculture is a profitable and efficient agricultural system which brings back biodiversity when the soil is depleted from plowing and chemical inputs\".She said the initiative, with funding from Switzerland and others, even covers Tunisia's sun-baked arid regions and aims to entice jobless young people to cultivate abandoned family land.It also hopes to help change a model \"where the Tunisian farmer loses money because he is constantly spending, for a very small yield, on seeds, fertilizers and pesticides\", said Mathlouthi.                A Tunisian association has set up a project called 'Plant Your Farm' hoping to create 50 micro-farms over five years to show that permaculture is a profitable and efficient agricultural system.             Permaculture also aims to help Tunisia adapt to the searing drought that has badly impacted a farm sector centered on wheat, barley and other water-intensive cereals.\"Crises such as water stress or the Ukraine war are opportunities to promote solutions such as agro-ecology and permaculture,\" said Mathlouthi.To help Tunisia's new eco-farmers sell their organic produce and spread the word on permaculture, the association has promoted farmers' markets and created a \"citizen food\" label.Families flocked to a recent workshop at a school in the northern city of Bizerte, where they learnt green farming techniques and sampled their tasty produce.\"These are healthy products,\" enthused father-of-three Salem Laghouati, 44. \"It's important to know what you're eating.\"Maissa Haddad, a 49-year-old schoolteacher, said she was proud to be \"educating children on permaculture\" and teaching them that it is \"beneficial for our planet and our lifestyle\".    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Planet-friendly farming takes root in drought-hit Tunisia (2023, May 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-planet-friendly-farming-root-drought-hit-tunisia.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the most likely reason for the reduction in damage?",
    "text": "For as long as humans have grown our own food, we have battled pest animals that destroy crops and take food for themselves.          The traditional approach has been to try to kill the pests, typically with poisons. Too often, however, this fails to kill enough pests, harms native animals, and only minimally reduces damage.We tackled this problem in a different way by asking: how do we stop hungry animals finding our crops in the first place?In a research paper published today, we show how \"chemical camouflage\" can prevent house mice finding newly sown wheat seeds. The method reduced mouse damage to wheat crops by more than 60% even during plague conditions, without killing a single mouse.The rodent menaceRodents are responsible for an estimated 70 million tons of grain lost worldwide each year. Even a 5% reduction in these losses could feed more than 280 million people.In Australia, the 2021 mouse plague cost farmers in New South Wales alone upwards of $1 billion, according to an industry association estimate. A mouse plague occurs somewhere in Australia at least every four years.Currently, the only management option to reduce mouse numbers is broad-scale baiting. However, baiting is often ineffective and has led to calls for more lethal poisons, which carry major risks for native wildlife.The relationship between baiting effort and crop yield is not well understood, and mouse numbers typically crash in plague years even without intervention. A better approach is to focus on reducing mouse impacts, rather than mouse numbers.How to fool a mouseMouse damage to Australia's most valuable crop, wheat, occurs mostly in the two-week period between sowing and germination. During this time, mice are attracted to the smell of the wheat germ\u2014the nutritious and fatty part of the seed\u2014beneath the ground, and they learn to dig up seeds with pinpoint accuracy, leading to significant crop losses.This led to our question: can we hide the seeds so mice can't find them?Like many animals, mice primarily use their sense of smell to find food. The world is full of odors, and hungry foragers must prioritize important smells and disregard useless ones.When a food is too difficult to find, or an odor is not a useful indicator of food, foragers must give up and search for something else to avoid wasting energy.Because hungry animals can't afford to waste effort on odors that don't lead to food, they are vulnerable to olfactory misinformation and chemical camouflage. As with visual camouflage, if the background, in this case smell, appears the same as the item we are trying to hide, the target item cannot be distinguished.Animals can also learn about the usefulness of information, making them vulnerable to another form of misinformation\u2014odor pre-exposure. By deploying food odors before food is available, foragers initially attracted to the odor repeatedly receive no reward and learn to ignore it.When the food does become available, foragers don't follow the odors because they know they're unrewarding. We recently used this technique to dramatically improve nest survival for threatened shorebirds at risk from by predation by invasive predators in New Zealand.      A test under tough conditionsUntil now, these techniques have been tested on relatively widely dispersed food items with fewer foragers over a larger area. Whether olfactory misinformation could protect a crop with more than 300 mice and 1.6 million seeds per hectare was unclear.We worked on a 27-hectare wheat paddock in southwest NSW, using 60 plots to test our two olfactory misinformation techniques. We used wheat germ oil to provide the odor background, as it is made from the part of wheat seeds that mice seek out and is a relatively cheap byproduct of the wheat-milling process.Both techniques involved spraying a fine mist of wheat germ oil solution onto the plots. Each application was equivalent to the smell of around 50 times the number of seeds on the plot.Our first technique, odor camouflage, began immediately after the crop was planted and was reapplied several times until seedlings appeared. This created a blanket of wheat odor to hide seeds from detection.Our second technique, odor pre-exposure, had wheat germ oil applied six days before the wheat crop was planted and continued for the week after. We predicted that mice attracted to the odor before seeds were planted would begin to ignore wheat odor after repeatedly finding no seeds.We also had three control treatments: one sprayed with canola oil to control for an oil effect, one we walked on without spraying to control for seed loss due to trampling, and one that remained totally untouched.One and two weeks after sowing, we counted mouse damage in the form of diggings where seeds had been extracted by mice. After two weeks, we also estimated the number of seedlings that were lost to mice. The results were staggering.After two weeks, our camouflage and pre-exposure treatments had reduced mouse damage by 63% and 74% respectively, compared to the control. We also estimated that 53% and 72% fewer seedlings, respectively, were lost to mice on these plots.The difference in the effect of pre-exposure to wheat odor and the effect of camouflage treatments was not statistically significant, and we concluded the camouflage effect is the most likely reason for the reduction in damage.Working with the animalsIn an increasingly populated world where food security is becoming a priority, we need new ways to tackle pest problems sustainably and safely.Our methods are simple, safe and highly effective, even during a mouse plague. They carry no risks for native wildlife and involve no killing. Mice don't go hungry either\u2014they simply eat the foods they ate before the wheat was planted.We believe simple behavioral interventions like ours, which work with animals' motivations rather than against them, are the way of the future in wildlife management and conservation.We believe this new approach has the potential to manage pest impacts without the side effects that come from using lethal pest control.

The study, recently published in the journal Ecology & Evolution, used GPS collars to track the movements of 13 chacma baboons in Cape Town, South Africa.The data revealed that when one collared female gave birth, she stopped using urban space without any significant change in daily distance traveled or social interactions that would be expected with general risk-sensitive behavior during this time.While only one baboon gave birth while wearing a GPS-recording tracking collar, the field team observed the same pattern of urban avoidance postpartum in two other non-collared females during the study.The researchers suggest that such changes in the baboon mothers' behavior may reduce the risks newborns might experience in the urban environment. It also presents a valuable insight into how species with slow life history strategies, investing in few offspring with extended parental care, need to adapt their behavior to cope with changes due to human activity within their lifetime.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the fungus that has invaded the West Coast?",
    "text": "It's a cold, wet day in 2015 and Anne Pringle is scouring the understory of a Northern California forest for the unassuming organism that has consumed her research for the last several years: the death cap mushroom, or Amanita phalloides.          This fungus isn't the whimsical, polka-dotted toadstool of childhood cartoon nostalgia, but the fatally toxic mushroom that has invaded the North American West Coast. Pringle and her lab have been collecting specimens to try and determine how the death cap has been able to invade this environment.Little did she know that eight years later, she and a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) would be the first to document some of the complexity behind that mystery.In a paper published this week in The ISME Journal, the team found that individual death cap mushrooms seem to have their own unique suite of toxin genes.\"In other words, not all mushrooms are poisonous in the same way,\" says Pringle, who is a professor of botany at UW\u2013Madison.The discovery could help researchers better understand how the toxic fungus is successfully invading California and open the door for new drug discovery pathways.Pringle, an evolutionary ecologist, was the first to determine that the population of death caps found in California is not native, as scientists previously thought; instead, the infamous fungus is an invasive species. Pringle wondered if part of the mushroom's invasion success lay in the toxins it's so well-known for. That meant she needed to get a better understanding of the genes that create these toxins.Pringle teamed up with UW\u2013Madison Medical Microbiology and Immunology professor Nancy Keller; former postdoctoral researcher Milton Drott; and Sung Chul Park, a current postdoctoral researcher in Keller's lab.Keller and her lab focus on picking apart the genetic reasons behind why a fungus, such as the carcinogenic Aspergillus flavus, may be a potent pathogen. They also study the potential for compounds isolated from pathogenic fungi to lead to new drug discovery.\"We're always looking for new compounds that could be useful for medicinal purposes,\" Keller says. \"We can take these new purified metabolites and say, 'Oh, do they impact growth of harmful microbes?' You just don't know until you test.\"      For the new study, Drott, who now works for the USDA-ARS, relied on his background in computational biology to analyze genetic data from samples of death cap mushrooms collected in California and Europe. The team was looking to document the genes underpinning their toxicity.What the researchers discovered was an unexpected diversity of such genes.All the specimens share a core group of genes regardless of their origin. Having these core genes is generally thought of as a requirement for a specimen to be classified as part of the death cap species, explains Drott.But the researchers also found an accessory group of genes. From individual to individual, some mushrooms had certain accessory genes while others were missing those same genes entirely.It's like if everyone at a lakeside barbecue had a citronella candle to help fend off pesky bugs. The citronella candle is like a core gene, emitting a smell to hopefully keep the bugs at bay. Now, if that lakeside turned into a swamp-side, the barbecue goers might have to adjust their bug-repelling strategy.In addition to their citronella candle, some people may bring bug spray, others might set up a mosquito trap, maybe some try a natural bug repellent oil. These extra bug repellent methods are like accessory genes, varied methods the barbecue goers are trying out to see what works best in the new location.In the mushrooms, Pringle believes these accessory genes create a variety of compounds, some of which may enable them to thrive best in new ecosystems and continue their invasion on the West Coast.\"We're documenting evolution, there's no doubt about that,\" Pringle says.But it's a really difficult question for researchers to test.In humans it's easy to trace the heritability of genes from parents to offspring, since people typically get two sets of genes, one from each parent. But in mushrooms it's much more complex. Sometimes individual mushrooms end up receiving a few versions of a gene. That makes it tricky to determine whether certain toxin genes play a role in helping a mushroom thrive in a particular environment.\"Computationally, that's very hard to deal with because you have to differentiate which one came from which parent or if it's altogether a unique sequence,\" Drott says. \"Teasing that apart was a major step forward in our ability to identify these toxins on this scale.\"Death cap mushrooms are also mycorrhizal, meaning they rely on plant roots to grow. That adds another layer of difficulty in designing experiments since it can be difficult or even impossible to recreate these conditions in the lab.And, the researchers note, the mere presence of genes doesn't always mean the compounds they're producing are definitely all toxins.\"When you're picking a mushroom, it's a moment in time. So, it could be at that moment the gene hasn't even been expressed and the compound not made,\" Keller says. \"We imagine that some of these genes are turned on due to stress. So ideally, you'd want to sample at different conditions.\"The team also notes that scientists don't yet know why the death cap mushroom is toxic in the first place: Is it for self-defense? Are mushrooms territorial? Do toxins and other mushroom compounds vary in different geographic locations for different reasons? Finding the answers to these questions isn't straightforward.However, the team is excited by the findings and the opportunity to add to the under-researched literature of fungal invasion biology.This is the first time that scientists have documented that there is so much variation between the native and invasive populations of death caps and where in the genome the variation exists, Drott says.\"There's something happening on the West Coast, where [the mushroom] is spreading,\" he says. \"Every year, people eat these mushrooms and die. And we want to stop that if we can.\" More information:Milton T.

    "text": "Over thousands of years some animals have specialized to live in environments where the sun never shines: giant squid with eyes the size of volleyballs see even in the darkest depths while others, like cave-dwelling olms, have lost the functionality of their eyes completely. But for animals that do not live in these extremes, how do species manage a world that suddenly becomes dark?          Lakes that become turbid from algal blooms, agricultural run-off, or other environmental pollutants represent common examples of environmental disturbances that can impact the visual scene that aquatic animals must navigate to survive.Metamorphic animals provide a unique opportunity to explore the effects of environmental turbidity throughout developmentResearchers from the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 turned to a peculiar species to explore the effects of long-lasting turbidity on animal behavior: Neotropical poison frogs.While poison frogs may not be the first animal that comes to mind to understand the impact of disturbance on vision in aquatic animals, the unique life history of these frogs makes them the perfect candidates to study the effects of turbidity throughout development. Poison frog tadpoles grow in small pools of water formed by vegetation (such as a leaf axil of a bromeliad) that serve as nurseries where individuals are confined until metamorphosis.\"These small pools of water can readily serve as natural 'simulations' of larger environments, such as lakes, as their small size makes them easy to measure and these pools vary significantly in their turbidity,\" explains Chloe Fouilloux from The Department of Biological and Environmental Science at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.Naturally, the water in pools can range from being as clear as drinking water to as dark as wine. As such, these environments can serve arenas to test how rearing conditions affect an animal's response to risk.Visibility makes a differenceUnexpectedly, the world within a leaf axil can be teeming with life from invertebrates to amphibian tadpoles. The goal of this multi-species comparison was to measure how turbidity affects an individual's response to the visual cues of predators in novel conditions. Researchers found that poison frog tadpoles that develop in clear environments are able to visually discriminate between different types of predators and respond accordingly. In contrast, those that have developed in darker environments exhibit weaker responses to the visual cues of predators.\"The responses from tadpoles illustrate how predator-prey interactions may shift in dynamic light environments and have important implications for the visual plasticity of animals in response to environmental change,\" says Bibiana Rojas, the project leader currently based at the Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology, Vienna.Researchers believe their findings may serve as a useful model to understand animal responses to habitat disturbance and how communities may shift when visually-guided animals are challenged.The paper is published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

    "text": "Scientists are learning more about the diets and groupings of little-studied Hector's dolphins at the top of the South Island.          Scientists have learned for the first time that groups of Hector's dolphins at the top of the South Island have distinctly different diets, suggesting sub-populations which don't intermingle.That information, discovered by University of Auckland scientists in collaboration with the Department of Conservation, may aid in monitoring and protecting the endangered dolphins, which probably number only a few hundred individuals in the area.The Hector's dolphins in Golden Bay don't seem to mingle with those on the opposite coast at Queen Charlotte Sound and Cloudy Bay in the Marlborough Sounds.\"We've known virtually nothing about the Hector's dolphins at the top of the South Island,\" says Professor Rochelle Constantine, a co-author of a study published in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. \"Small and isolated sub-populations can be more vulnerable to environmental risks, so this is very useful information to know.\"Hector's dolphins, one of the world's smallest marine dolphins, are found only in Aotearoa New Zealand. They have gray, white and black markings and a black dorsal fin that looks like one of Mickey Mouse's ears.Analyzing chemical markers in tissue samples allowed Ph.D. student Courtney Ogilvy and her fellow scientists to deduce what the dolphins were eating and where. The different diets suggested that the groups were staying apart, targeting different prey.Clear or deep water between Golden Bay on the west coast and Queen Charlotte Sound and Cloudy Bay on the east coast may be deterring movement between the coasts. Hector's dolphins prefer turbid, shallow coastal water over clear, deep water.\"There certainly seems to be an ecological boundary that prevents the movement of Hector's dolphins between the two regions,\" says Ogilvy, who is in the School of Biological Sciences.She analyzed 111 skin samples collected over 11 years by the Department of Conservation\u2014Te Papa Atawhai (DOC) and Waipapa Taumata Rau\u2014University of Auckland as part of a genetic monitoring program.\"We are using genetics to better understand the connections between dolphins across the top of the South Island,\" says Constantine. \"This, combined with the diet study will allow us to better inform measures to help these dolphin populations thrive.\"Carbon and nitrogen isotopes in animals' tissues reflect their prey, which in the case of Hector's dolphins is small fish and squid. The chemical analysis doesn't reveal which exact species a dolphin is eating.The total population of Hector's dolphins is estimated at more than 15,000 individuals.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the site that Weitzel studied?",
    "text": "In Connecticut, deer are a frequent sight, whether they are quietly munching on plants around our yards, bounding into the cover of trees with a flash of white from their tails, or after they don't safely make it across a busy road. Though we may take them for granted, these deer have been here for millennia, and their story is intertwined with the human story of our region.          Elic Weitzel is a UConn anthropology Ph.D. candidate studying resource management from the past, and the history of white-tailed deer in the region is providing a glimpse into what life was like for people in Connecticut centuries ago.Weitzel analyzed thousands of animal bones from a Wangunk tribal settlement just south of present-day Hartford to learn more about the Wangunk and to glean information about their hunting practices, specifically to look for evidence that hunting in the pre-colonial period had negative impacts on deer. His findings are published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.The site, called the Morgan Site, was a maize horticultural village occupied from the 11th to 14th centuries, explains Weitzel, and the data indicate interesting patterns about white-tailed deer in Connecticut, supporting a hypothesis that white-tailed deer are resilient to overhunting by humans.\"I think it's an important data point for wildlife managers, for archaeologists, and for everybody to understand what's going on with deer in New England,\" says Weitzel.                Weitzel in UConn\u2019s Zooarchaeology Laboratory working with bone specimens from the comparative collection. Credit: UConn Photo             After the white-tailed deer population grew to near-ubiquity around 8,000 years ago, Weitzel says the species became an important food resource for those living in eastern North America. Indigenous populations hunted the deer for thousands of years and later, European settlers in the colonial period also relied heavily on deer, nearly driving the species to extinction. Weitzel is hoping to set a pre-colonization baseline of the white-tailed population to better understand how the deer's resilience changed post-European contact.\"Archaeologists struggle to find clear evidence that white-tailed deer populations were ever negatively impacted by Native hunting. I've looked at archaeological sites in Alabama and I didn't find evidence of over-exploitation of white-tailed deer going on.\"      \"Ecologists estimate that there might have been between 9 and 18 million white-tailed deer on the eve of European colonization, around 15-1600 AD, but we know for sure that by 1900 AD, just 123 years ago, there were only 300,000 white-tailed deer in all North America. That is only one to five percent of what their original population was after thousands of years that Native folks were hunting deer regularly.\"Weitzel analyzed around 3,000 animal bones excavated from the Morgan Site, representing species like raccoons, turtles, a black bear, and bobcat bones, but the majority belonged to the abundant white-tailed deer, which is why he focused on that species.Other lines of evidence indicate the presence of a high population of deer, says Weitzel, such as finding complete skeletons.                A tray containing bone fragments excavated from the Morgan Site, representing species like raccoons, turtles, black bear, and bobcat bones, but the majority belonged to white-tailed deer. Credit: Contributed photo             \"When a hunter goes out far away, they're generally not going to drag an entire carcass back home: they'll butcher it in the field, remove the lower utility pieces, and bring back the higher yield parts. When you're closer to home, you might be able to drag the whole carcass back and that seems to be the pattern that's dominating this site. It doesn't seem like they were really having to go too far away to hunt because of the high deer populations close to the site.\"Weitzel also found that the skeletons were primarily from adult animals, indicating low hunting pressure. He explains that when a species' population starts to decline, hunters may start seeking out younger animals, however, Weitzel found no fawns and few yearlings represented at the site.\"I think the most surprising result was the size of the deer that I identified in this assemblage\u2014these were big deer. Some of the antlers are on par with record-holding animals from today and I was able to calculate the estimated live weight of these deer. For example, in Connecticut today, deer pretty much don't get larger than 200 pounds but the largest deer on this site was 265 pounds. The largest deer in Connecticut today is pretty much only the average deer from this site,\" says Weitzel.Deer body size is sensitive to food availability and indicates how productive the environment is. Weitzel thinks this makes the case that the productive environment supporting these deer populations was carefully managed by the Indigenous population through methods such as prescribed burns to promote a lush and sustainable landscape.Weitzel notes the 95 to 99% mortality of deer is parallel to some of the higher estimates for what happened to the Native human population post-contact.\"I don't think that's a coincidence. I think that fundamentally the same processes are at work in both cases in a general ecological sense, not necessarily the epidemic disease part, but the fact that it is something new when you have Euro-American settlers colonizing the region and changing the ecology in various ways and it is impacting people, it is impacting animals, it is impacting plants. It's impacting the entire ecosystem of eastern North America, in negative ways.\"These findings also challenge deeper assumptions about human nature. Weitzel points out that many believe that humans are inherently bad for the environment and separate from nature, yet there is ample evidence to suggest otherwise. Findings such as these can tell us a lot about ourselves as a species and our own economic systems and role in our ecosystem.\"To my mind, it's not the existence of people that causes negative environmental impacts, it's certain things that certain people do. We know that Indigenous people all over the world and throughout time have had positive impacts on the environment. One of my favorite examples is from western Australia where in the early 20th century, the Australian government removed Aboriginal Australians from their territories.\"\"There were extinctions and ecological collapse because they removed humans, an integral piece of an ecosystem, and once you remove them from that equation, the ecosystem suffered. Once Aboriginal peoples were allowed to return to their home territories, the ecosystem started to thrive and flourish again.\"Weitzel hopes this research can help inform wildlife managers and ecologists to understand the historical ecology of the species, and to establish baselines for sustainable management. Since there is so much that is still unknown, this work will help answer some of those questions, such as what were the exact causes and mechanisms for the high mortality rates in the white-tailed deer population? Weitzel is digging into this and other questions for the rest of his dissertation.\"Wildlife managers often struggle to figure out what the baseline should be that they're trying to return to. Archaeological data contributes to that, but I also think this contributes to broader discussions about how humans interact with their environment, and that there are ways that we can manage environments sustainably and interact with resources sustainably. That seems to be what Native folks were doing and then there are ways that we can interact unsustainably and that seems to be what happened in the colonial period.\" More information:Elic M.

    "text": "Karst forests develop in a karst landform, and have complex vegetation types and high biodiversity, and are rich in endemic species. As one of the important and special plant groups in the karst habitat, many orchids have unique adaption mechanisms. However, the distribution pattern and conservation status of orchids in karst forests remain largely unknown.          Researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their collaborators conducted a comprehensive survey of the orchid flora in a karst forest located in southeast Yunnan, China. They aimed to determine the species richness, distribution, and conservation status of orchid species in Wanfengshan Nature Reserve.The researchers conducted systematic field surveys in Wanfengshan Nature Reserve from 2019 to 2022. They identified 78 orchid species of 35 genera in eight isolated hills, indicating that the orchids are of high richness in the karst forest of Wanfengshan Nature Reserve, and the community is occupied by terrestrial orchids.The researchers found the maximum richness of orchids at middle and high elevations. They observed most of the epiphytes and terrestrial species in the lower and higher peaks, respectively. Due to physical barriers to dispersal, each isolated small hill has a different assemblage of species.They also observed that more than one third of the orchid species are threatened, especially those with ornamental and medicinal value, although the fact that all orchids are well protected in the nature reserve.The researchers therefore call for more attention to be paid to the conservation of orchids in the karst forest. They suggest that more research should be conducted on the mechanisms of ecological adaptation, mycorrhizal interactions, and pollination of orchids in karst forests, and effective ways to restore and conserve orchids.Related results were published in Forest Ecosystems.

    "text": "Ask anyone living in a coastal area of the UK and they'll confirm that seagulls can be a nuisance. These birds' pilfering of food knows no bounds, and no one is safe from one of their thieving attacks.          For many people, this behavior is the result of the gulls' inherent aggression. But in reality, gulls such as the herring gull are more intelligent than we give them credit for, particularly in terms of their social skills. These birds are able to pay attention to the behavior of others and use the information they gather to inform their own foraging choices.Herring gulls thrive in modern urban areas. Urban gull colonies have taken off since making European cities their home in the mid-20th century, despite the general decline in gulls' overall population. As a species, they have also shown great flexibility in their diet, nesting and reproductive behavior.As a scientist interested in animal cognition, I'm fascinated by the intelligent behavior that allows gulls to successfully forage human foods. Research has already shown that urban herring gulls adapt their foraging behavior to human activity patterns, increase their attention towards a person in possession of food and that they prefer food that has been touched by a person compared to food that has not.To build on this, my masters students Franziska Feist and Kiera Smith and I set out to discover if the birds could not only track objects handled by humans, but if they could also compare objects in their environment with those being manipulated by a person. The ability to compare objects and identify whether they are identical implies a higher cognitive ability than object tracking alone.Our paper is published in the journal Biology Letters.Quick learnersWe placed two Walkers brand crisp packets of different colors on the ground a few meters in front of single or small groups of herring gulls on Brighton beach. We sat on the sand and held a third crisp packet that matched the color of either one of the packets on the ground. We then recorded the gulls' response to see if, as hypothesized, they would choose the crisp packet that matched the color of the one in our hand.Of the gulls that pecked at the crisp packets, nearly all (95%) did so to the crisp packet that color-matched the one we were holding. This suggests that these gulls possess the ability to identify and compare objects within their surroundings. In addition, the gulls' seemed to observe the foraging choices of others\u2014specifically people in this case\u2014and use the information they obtained to decide what to eat.The number of approaches towards us did not differ significantly between adults and young birds (meaning, any with brown plumage). However, the majority that made an attempt at stealing one of the crisp packets were adults. Around 86% of the recorded pecks came from adults, despite these birds making up just 46% of our entire sample.This suggests that stealing food requires a certain level of boldness and skill that most young birds lack. Another plausible explanation is that the young birds may have been deterred by the competition with adult birds, which they are likely to lose.      Wide behavioral repertoireOur findings are interesting because herring gulls have not evolved with humans. In fact, their urbanization only began relatively recently\u2014around 80 years ago.That means this behavior cannot have come from an innate ability resulting from co-evolution or an extended period of living alongside humans. Rather, it must be the result of a broader, more general behavioral repertoire.From a scientific perspective, this is fascinating. It seems that herring gulls are an intelligent and versatile predator that has successfully adapted to urban environments due to their observational skills and behavioral flexibility.Yet, for many people, this may have some rather negative implications. Coastal residents and visitors frequently experience the impressive yet annoying ability of these birds to observe, target and steal food from picnics, bins and people directly.We suggest that these problems likely stem from more than people feeding urban gulls directly. It seems that simply watching us eat something will make that specific food item, and any identical items in the vicinity, more attractive to these birds. It is this cognitive toolkit that will make tension between humans and urban herring gulls difficult to manage.Our work does, however, agree with existing studies that suggest only around a quarter of the UK urban gull population will actually attempt to steal food from a person. Less than a fifth of the gulls we sampled approached the crisp packets when when we were sitting nearby.Regardless, any attempt to minimize conflict should extend beyond deterring people from feeding gulls and should take into account these birds' exceptional observational skills. What is clear, though, is that we can't rely solely on signs insisting that people \"do not feed the birds.\" More information:Franziska Feist et al, Inter-species stimulus enhancement: herring gulls ( Larus argentatus ) mimic human food choice during foraging, Biology Letters (2023).

The paper is published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology.The researchers found that Caenorhabditis elegans fed Bacillus subtilis var. natto had a significantly longer lifespan than those fed the standard diet, and further elucidated that the p38 MAPK pathway and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling pathway, which are known to be involved in innate immunity and lifespan, were involved in the lifespan-enhancing effects of Bacillus subtilis var. natto. They also examined stress tolerance, which has been shown to have a correlation with longevity, and found that resistance to UV light and oxidative stress is enhanced.Professor Nakadai concluded, \"For the first time, we were able to demonstrate the possibility of lifespan-extending effects of Caenorhabditis elegans through the ingestion of Bacillus subtilis var. natto. We hope that future experiments on mammals and epidemiological studies will help to realize a healthy and longer-living society if we can apply this research to humans.\" More information:Nao Teramoto et al, Impacts of Bacillus subtilis var. natto on the lifespan and stress resistance of Caenorhabditis elegans, Journal of Applied Microbiology (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is an important parameter to take into account in models for predicting disease transmission?",
    "text": "Mosquitoes have thermal preferences. This is an important parameter to better predict outbreaks of diseases transmitted by these insects.          \"If they have a choice, when it's hot, mosquitoes hide in a cool place to rest,\" says Niels Verhulst, author of a study recently published in the Journal of Thermal Biology. The entomologist from the University of Zurich summarizes the results of the experiment he conducted with his team. They have been working for several years to better understand mosquito behavior. These insects are vectors of many important pathogens for humans and animals, that cause dengue, West Nile fever or malaria, so it is crucial to be able to predict how their populations develop.Four degrees lower is more restfulVerhulst's study examined for the first time outside a laboratory the thermal preferences of the insects. To this end, he observed the temperature of the places where the mosquitoes rested\u2014an activity that occupies most of their time\u2014when they were released in a large, special cage outdoors during the summer. Specifically, he introduced between 100 and 200 females of the species Aedes japonicus (Asian bush mosquito), into the cage on 19 occasions.This cage was equipped with three resting boxes whose temperature had been treated to create a relatively cool microhabitat with approximately 18\u00b0C over the duration of the experiment and a warm microhabitat with approximately 35\u00b0C in addition to an untreated ambient microhabitat with approximately 26\u00b0C. Mosquitoes could freely enter and leave the boxes. For each trial, mosquitoes resting in the three boxes were counted five times, every two hours.The researcher observed that among the resting boxes, the mosquitoes' preference was for the coolest box. This phenomenon became more and more pronounced during the day, as the ambient temperature increased. \"Across the experiments, the resting temperatures of Aedes japonicus were on average four degrees lower than the ambient temperatures measured by the nearby weather station,\" Verhulst says.These results need to be refined over longer periods of time and, in particular, with infected mosquitoes capable of transmitting diseases. Scientists do not know, for example, whether such mosquitoes also prefer cooler temperatures or whether they prefer warmer places to shed pathogens, the same way we do to get rid of a virus when we have a fever.Microclimates that favor survivalIn any case, the thermal preferences of mosquitoes are an important parameter to take into account in models for predicting disease transmission.\"Currently, models cannot correctly predict the development of mosquito populations and their pathogens since they are based on ambient temperatures measured by weather stations. However, these stations measure temperatures at an altitude of two meters in the middle of fields, where no mosquitoes are found anyway. Thus, based on this average temperature alone, a model could estimate that mosquitoes cannot survive in a certain area because it is too hot, while in reality, by finding cooler microclimates, the mosquito will be quite capable of reproducing and transmitting diseases,\" Verhulst explains. Refining the models by taking this parameter into account will also be important for predicting population movements of the insect in the wake of climate change.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the chemical that kills nematodes?",
    "text": "A team of horticulturists affiliated with a host of institutions in Canada and the U.S. has found a chemical that kills crop-parasitizing nematodes in the soil without killing other organisms. The study is reported in the journal Nature. The editors of the journal have also published a Research Briefing in the same issue outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.          As the world population continues to grow, scientists are seeking ways to feed them. One such effort is focused on increasing yields of existing crops by reducing losses due to organisms that eat or parasitize them, such as nematodes. Certain types of nematodes have been identified as a main target of research because they cause more than $100 billion in crop losses around the world each year.Prior efforts to protect crops from nematodes have revolved around the use of pesticides. Unfortunately, virtually all of them also kill helpful organisms in the soil. Thus, the search for a safer nematicide has continued. In this new effort, the research team tested the effectiveness and safety of a chemical called selectivin. Prior research in 2016 found that it is chemically similar to a drug called levamisole and that it kills nematodes.The team began by learning more about what happens when nematodes are exposed to selectivin. They found the tiny creatures absorb the chemical and once they do, enzymes called cytochrome P450s are modified, turning them into toxic chemicals. They also found that soil-based oxygen is required for the modification to take place. Further testing showed that things were different for other organisms in the soil\u2014when they absorbed the chemical, they did not convert any proteins into toxic chemicals. Thus, the chemical appeared to kill only nematodes in soil.To find out if the chemical would work as hoped in the real world, the team collaborated with the USDA, testing the impact of treating soil with selectivin in a greenhouse growing tomato plants. The team found it controlled the nematodes as well or better than other commercially available products, but unlike those products, it did not harm other organisms in the soil.More testing is required\u2014typically, pesticides undergo a decade of testing before they are approved for use on commercial crops, but the team is optimistic that they have finally found a solution to the problem of nematodes.

    "question_squad": " What is Trichodesmium a type of?",
    "text": "A team of environmental engineers at ETH Zurich's Institute of Environmental Engineering working with a colleague from the University of Luxembourg has found that the movement of individual gliding filaments of Trichodesmium and the way they interact with other filaments helps them to form aggregates. In their study, published in the journal Science, the group studied how samples of Trichodesmium in their lab reacted to environmental events such as bright light.          Trichodesmium is a type of bacterium that is plentiful in the oceans. Groups of them are unique in that they can join together to form structures, such as filaments several hundred cells long. Such filaments can exist as standalone entities or they can bunch together with other filaments, creating larger structures, many of which resemble pom-poms or tufts of hair. Trichodesmium are also valuable to ocean life because they are responsible for fixing most of the nitrogen that provides compounds used to survive by other plants.In this new effort, the research team noticed that little research has investigated the means by which Trichodesmium interact and bind together. To learn more, they collected several specimens and brought them back to their lab for study.One of the first things the team learned is that individual strands can, at times, glide along the length of another strand. And when they reach the ends of a strand, they can reverse direction. In many instances, both strands engaged in gliding and both reversed direction to maintain contact. The research team also found that when strands bunch together, the reversals tended to happen more often, helping to keep them bunched together.Credit: Science (2023). DOI: 10.1126/science.adf2753The researchers also found that the strands could react quickly to changes in light intensity\u2014they tended to bunch quickly when suddenly exposed to light and loosened when the light was removed. They suggest that in a natural setting, this could be a response to cloud movements changing light intensity. The team also found evidence that the tightness of a bunch could be related to buoyancy, allowing a bunch to sink lower into the water, when need be, such as when nutrient levels changed.

    "text": "The marine ecosystems of the South Atlantic Ocean have experienced a significant decline in recent decades due to overfishing and habitat degradation. This is demonstrated by a scientific study led by the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) that sheds light on the magnitude of human impact on these once thriving marine areas based on the archaeological analysis of fish remains from several sites in Brazil.          The Indigenous communities that inhabited the southern coast of Brazil for thousands of years enjoyed abundant and diverse marine ecosystems teeming with large, high trophic level fish and top predators that played an important role in their food security in the past. This allowed their periodic exploitation by Indigenous populations with simple fishing technology for thousands of years.After comparing the archaeological remains of fish species from the past with the present-day fish populations, the results show a significant decrease in many of the species, particularly sharks and rays, possibly linked to the escalating human impacts, such as overfishing and habitat degradation in recent decades.Thiago Fossile, lead author and researcher at ICTA-UAB and the UAB Department of Prehistory, emphasizes the growing anthropogenic pressures faced by aquatic fauna in Brazil, a country known for its stunning beaches and diverse wildlife. \"Many species documented in archaeological sites are now endangered, while for other species there is insufficient data on their distribution and abundance. By using archaeological data, we can gain insight into these lost environments and can redefine conservation baselines.\"Andr\u00e9 Colonese, senior author of the study and researcher at ICTA-UAB and the Department of Prehistory at UAB, highlights the importance of coastal and marine ecosystems in sustaining subsistence fisheries for thousands of years along the Brazilian coast. \"Hundreds of archaeological sites provide valuable information on past biodiversity, contributing to discussions on fisheries management and conservation. This study emphasizes the significance of incorporating archaeological data into conservation debates in Brazil, enhancing the discipline's relevance to environmental issues.\"For Mariana Bender, co-author from the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, the study offers a new perspective into the understanding of the exploitation of fish biodiversity through time. \"It is amazing what archaeological sites can tell us relative to the impacts of ancient human populations on fish biodiversity. Looking at fish characteristics we found evidence that large top predators have long been exploited and recent fisheries have moved towards lower trophic levels. This process is not recent, but instead, has been in place for thousands of years,\" she says.Co-author Dione Bandeira of the Universidade da Regi\u00e3o de Joinville (Brazil) explained, \"Indigenous environmental stewardship serves as a model for sustainable resource utilization and plays a crucial role in conserving biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions of South America. Additionally, studies focusing on archaeological faunal remains provide valuable insights into the origins and evolution of these enduring practices.\"The study is published in the journal PLOS ONE.

    "text": "Researchers from Nagoya City University have made an important advancement in the field of cellular imaging with the development of Seg2Link, a software tool that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and semi-automated correction techniques to accurately segment cells in 3D images from a stack of 2D images. This solution bridges the gap between AI predictions and real-world accuracy, enabling scientists to process large-scale image data more efficiently. Their paper is published in the journal Scientific Reports.       Traditional AI-based methods for cell segmentation have their limitations, mainly due to inaccuracies in the automated detection of cellular regions. To address this, Seg2Link integrates deep learning technology with efficient manual corrections. Users can easily refine the AI-determined cell regions in the first 2D image, and the software will semi-automatically apply these corrections to subsequent 2D slices, dramatically reducing the time and effort required for 3D cell segmentation.Notably, the software is designed to be user-friendly and can run efficiently on standard personal computers. This means that even non-experts can utilize Seg2Link to process large-scale image data quickly, a significant advantage given the current trend of biological images becoming increasingly large-scale, or \"big data.\"The implications of this development are wide-reaching, with the potential to catalyze research progress in various fields. In medicine and biology, for instance, efficient processing of biological images could accelerate research into tumor cell proliferation, cancer progression, and treatment effectiveness. The software could also assist in analyzing neural circuits, helping to further understand brain disorders.

    "question_squad": " What is the region of DNA that is important for chromosome separation during cell division?",
    "text": "When creating a computer program, errors in the code can introduce bugs to the software. Similarly, errors in our body's genetic code, DNA, which is stored in structures known as chromosomes, can bring about mutations in the body. These mutations are the cause of many deadly diseases\u2014including cancer. Now, researchers in Japan have shed new light on a particular type of genetic mutation: gross chromosomal rearrangement (GCR).          In a new study published in Communications Biology, a multi-institutional team led by researchers from Osaka University analyzed fission yeast to identify two key genes involved in the process of GCR.The researchers were particularly interested in the centromere, a region important for chromosome separation during cell division. The centromere contains repeating DNA sequences, and GCR is known to occur at areas where DNA sequences repeat. Rad51 is a key enzyme involved in DNA recombination that exchanges genetic material. In contrast to what one can expect, however, Rad51 suppresses rather than promotes GCR at the centromere. It is enigmatic how GCRs occur using the centromere repeat.\"To find genes that are involved in the occurrence of GCR, we introduced mutations to yeast lacking Rad51, which exhibit increased levels of GCR,\" says senior author Takuro Nakagawa. \"We searched for cells that showed reduced levels of GCR and found that cells with mutations in the genes Srr1 and Skb1 had less GCR, suggesting that these genes play a role in the occurrence of GCR.\"The researchers then deleted the Srr1 and Skb1 genes in yeast lacking Rad51 and evaluated the occurrence of GCR. Cells lacking Srr1 and cells lacking Skb1 exhibited reduced rates of GCR; cells lacking both genes exhibited even lower rates of GCR.\"Our analysis revealed that Srr1 and Skb1 are involved in the formation of isochromosomes, a type of structural mutation in the chromosome,\" says the lead author of the study Piyusha Mongia. \"Loss of Srr1 or Skb1 led to a significant reduction in the number of isochromosomes that occurred.\"The research team's findings represent an important step toward understanding the mechanisms underlying GCR at the centromere. Because GCRs are involved in several genetic disorders, including cancer, understanding the process of GCR formation may advance our ability to treat certain genetic diseases.

    "text": "Three cheetah cubs born to a big cat that was brought to India from Africa last year died in central India's Kuno National Park in the past week, forest officials said, as a heat wave in the region sent temperatures soaring.          The cubs were the first to be born in India in more than seven decades. Once widespread in India, cheetahs became extinct in 1952 from hunting and habitat loss. Their mother was among the 20 cheetahs that India flew in from Namibia and South Africa as part of an ambitious and hotly contested plan to reintroduce the world's fastest land animal to the South Asian country.The first cub died on Tuesday, prompting veterinarians in the national park in Madhya Pradesh state to closely monitor the mother and her three remaining cubs. The cubs appeared weak on Thursday afternoon\u2014a day when temperatures spiked to 47 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit)\u2014and authorities intervened to help the cats.They were \"weak, underweight and highly dehydrated\" and two of them later died, forest officials said in a statement Thursday.The last surviving cub is being treated in a critical care facility.Officials didn't say what caused the deaths but a scorching heat wave in India is believed to have weakened the cubs. The survival rate of cheetah cubs both in the wild and captivity is low, according to experts.                A cheetah lies inside a transport cage at the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) before being relocated to India, in Otjiwarongo, Namibia, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. Three cheetah cubs, born to a big cat brought to India from Africa last year, died in May, 2023.

Credit: AP Photo/Denis Farrell, File             The cats were introduced with much fanfare and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the cats would catalyze efforts to conserve India's neglected grasslands. But of the 20 adult cheetahs imported to India, three\u2014two females and a male\u2014have died.Fewer than 7,000 adult cheetahs remain in the wild globally, and they now inhabit less than 9% of their original range.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the fungus that grows on the roots of hardwood trees?",
    "text": "Climate change is subjecting plants to rapid shifts in temperature and precipitation, pushing them into new ranges and stressing them in old ones.          Trees may have an easier time adapting in both cases by making new microbial friends underground, according to new research from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison published today in the journal Science.Plants live across wide ranges of heat and cold and rain and drought, but they don't fill their niches alone. Along with the animals and insects that live on and around a tree\u2014pitching in now and then to aid pollination or pest control or seed dispersal\u2014there are innumerable microbes in the soil (like various fungi that grow alongside tree roots). These microbes can blunt the normal stresses of life by helping trees draw in more nutrients and water or influencing the time they leaf out or flower to best match seasonal conditions.That relationship could play an important role in climate adaptation.\"Climate change is adding new stress faster than most trees are used to,\" says Richard Lankau, UW\u2013Madison professor of plant pathology. \"We have some sense of how most tree species are going to have to react\u2014where they will be pushed out and where they can move. But that's based on what we think the trees themselves can handle. Forests may actually be more resilient if we give them credit for shifting microbial communities.\"                Underground, the fungus Tylopilus rubrobrunneus grows along the roots of hardwood trees like oaks. The symbiotic relationships between trees and fungi can help the plants survive extreme shifts in temperature and moisture driven by climate change. Credit: Cassandra Allsup             To test the way communities of microbes from different locales affected stressed trees, Lankau, along with research scientist Cassandra Allsup and research specialist Isabelle George, planted trees at the distant edges of their current ranges. Seedlings from a long list of deciduous species\u2014oak, elm, hickory, maple and more\u2014went into the ground about 450 miles apart in plots in northern Wisconsin and central Illinois.Before the trees were moved to the distant plots, they were sprouted from seeds in UW\u2013Madison greenhouses in different soil samples collected from 12 sites in Illinois and Wisconsin, establishing distinct microbial relationships. Some of the trees were grown in familiar soil collected near the central part of the trees' ranges. Some were introduced to new microbial communities by sprouting in soil collected from sites physically closer to (or more alike in typical temperature and rainfall conditions) to the experimental plots in which they would live for three years.      Up north at UW\u2013Madison's Kemp Natural Resources Station, where broadleaf forests naturally give way to woods dominated by evergreen trees, the effects of tree-microbe relationships were stark.\"The trees all survived summer just fine, unless they were eaten by a deer,\" says Lankau. \"It's the cold winter where we saw a separation in success. The seedlings exposed to microbes from northern sites were much more likely to survive the winter than those pre-inoculated with microbes from southern Wisconsin, the normal heart of where they live.\"Trees grown with microbes sampled from the coldest sites were at least 50% more likely to survive through three cold winters in what might be the new, leading edge of the climate-shifted range, according to the researchers' results.                Fungi covers the roots of a white oak tree, a relationship that can help the tree survive extreme conditions\u2014such and climate change-driven temperature increases and droughts. Credit: Cassandra Allsup             At the southern site, where trees would likely be subjected to higher temperatures than they prefer, results were similarly positive for trees matched with microbes acquainted with the climate\u2014though the boost in resilience was limited to tree species that tend to pair with certain types of microbes, called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, that pierce plant cell walls. Trees subjected to artificial drought and paired with microbes imported from the driest conditions got the biggest survival boost, possibly a result of arbuscular fungi's talent for collecting moisture.On top of a better understanding of the way trees and microbes work together in a race against climate change, plant-fungi matchmaking may be a boon to plans to reforest the planet.\"The number of trees pledged to be planted worldwide in climate change mitigation strategies is just astronomical,\" says Lankau. \"Planting trees is the one climate change mitigation strategy that everyone agrees with, so everyone has a plan to plant billions and trillions of new trees.\"While it's no help to mature growth or the next generation of naturally seeded trees, Lankau's lab is recruiting tree nurseries across the Midwest as partners in more microbe-inoculation projects to give new seedlings a leg up.\"We're wondering if we can capitalize on this study, whether it can be used strategically in different areas of the country,\" Lankau says. \"If we're going to come anywhere close to the tree-planting and forest-acreage-restoration targets governments have set, ideas like this could have a significant impact on the success of those projects.\" More information:Cassandra M.

The three females estimated to be a month old were found May 18 nestled in a patch of poison oak in the Simi Hills area about 40 miles (65 km) northwest of downtown LA, the park service said in a statement.They were born to a 5-year-old cougar dubbed P-77 that has been tracked since November 2019. Scientists are calling the babies P-113, P-114 and P-115.The father isn't immediately known. Biologists aren't currently following any male cougars in P-77's habitat, so they suspect the father might have come from nearby mountains and then went back.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the imaging system that helps surgeons distinguish between cancerous and benign tissue?",
    "text": "On a sunny springtime stroll through a park, it's easy to ignore the parts of plants that are hidden from view. Plant biologists see things differently. They look below the surface where plant roots are organized in elaborate systems that are critical to the organism's development. Intricately organized tree root systems, for example, can span as far underground as the tree grows high above the soil.          Applying an advanced imaging technology to plant roots, researchers at the University of California San Diego and Stanford University have developed a new understanding of essential root chemicals that are responsible for plant growth. Using a type of mass spectrometer, a study led by UC San Diego Biological Sciences Postdoctoral Scholar Tao Zhang and Assistant Professor Alexandra Dickinson produced a \"roadmap\" that profiles where key small molecules are distributed along stem cells of maize (corn) plant roots and how their placement factors into the plant's maturation. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.\"This chemical roadmap provides a resource that scientists can use to find new ways of regulating plant growth,\" said Dickinson, a faculty member in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. \"Having more information about how roots grow could be useful in conservation as we think about protecting our plants in natural environments and making them more sustainable, especially in agriculture.\"While working as a visiting scientist at Stanford University, Dickinson began collaborating with study co-first author Sarah Noll and Professor Richard Zare, who developed a mass spectrometry imaging system that helps surgeons distinguish between cancerous and benign tissue during tumor-removal operations.Dickinson, Zare and Noll adapted the technology\u2014called \"desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging\" or DESI-MSI\u2014to probe plant roots for the chemicals involved in growth and energy production. They initially focused on maize plants at the root tips, where stem cells play an active role in the plant's development. Their method involved cutting through the center of the root to get a clear image of the chemicals inside.\"To help understand plant roots from the biology side, we needed to find out which chemicals are there,\" said Zare. \"Our imaging system sprays out droplets that strike different portions of the root and dissolve chemicals at that location. A mass spectrometer collects the droplet splash and tells us what those dissolved chemicals are. By systematically scanning the droplet target spot we make a spatial map of the root chemicals.\"                Researchers used an advanced imaging technology to develop a new understanding of essential root chemicals that are responsible for plant growth. Credit: Dickinson Lab, UC San Diego             The resulting images, believed to be some of the first to reveal the transition between stem cells and mature root tissue, show the foundational role of metabolites\u2014molecules involved in the plant's energy production. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites became the focus of the research since they were found to be a key player in controlling root development.Coming into the study, the researchers expected a relatively uniform distribution of chemicals. Instead, with their chemical roadmap in hand, they found that TCA metabolites are clustered in patches across the root.\"I was surprised by how many chemicals are featured in really distinct patterns,\" said Dickinson. \"We can see that the plant is doing this on purpose\u2014it needs these molecules in specific regions to grow properly.\" The Dickinson lab showed that these TCA metabolites have predictable effects in development, not only in maize, but in another plant species as well (Arabidopsis). This is likely because TCA metabolites are highly conserved\u2014they are made in all plants as well as animals.Also emerging from the new images were previously unidentified chemical compounds. Dickinson says the mystery compounds could be critical for plant growth since they also are grouped in patterns at specific locations, suggesting a prominent role in development. Dickinson and her colleagues are now investigating these compounds and comparing varieties of maize that have different levels of stress resistance for adverse threats such as severe climate conditions and drought. The new information will help them develop novel chemical and genetic strategies for improving plant growth and stress resilience.\"We're looking at different maize plants that have drought resistance to see if we've already found chemicals that are specific to that variety that we haven't seen in other varieties,\" said Dickinson. \"We think that could be a way to find new compounds that can promote growth, especially in harsh conditions.\"The study's full author list includes: Tao Zhang, Sarah Noll, Jesus Peng, Amman Klair, Abigail Tripka, Nathan Stutzman, Casey Cheng, Richard Zare and Alexandra Dickinson.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the fibers that can change shape and generate force like a muscle?",
    "text": "In two new studies, North Carolina State University researchers have designed and tested a series of textile fibers that can change shape and generate force like a muscle. In the first study, published in Actuators, the researchers focused on the materials' influence on artificial muscles' strength and contraction length. The findings could help researchers tailor the fibers for different applications.          In the second, proof-of-concept study published in Biomimetics, the researchers tested their fibers as scaffolds for live cells. Their findings suggest the fibers\u2014known as \"fiber robots\"\u2014could potentially be used to develop 3D models of living, moving systems in the human body.\"We found that our fiber robot is a very suitable scaffold for the cells, and we can alter the frequency and contraction ratio to create a more suitable environment for cells,\" said Muh Amdadul Hoque, graduate student in textile engineering, chemistry and science at NC State. \"These were proof-of concept studies; ultimately, our goal is to see if we can study these fibers as a scaffold for stem cells, or use them to develop artificial organs in future studies.\"Researchers made the shape-changing fibers by encapsulating a balloon-like tube, made of a material similar to rubber, in a braided textile sheath. Inflating the interior balloon with an air pump makes the braided sheath expand, causing it to shorten.The researchers measured the force and contraction rates of fibers made from different materials in order to understand the relationship between material and performance. They found that stronger, larger-diameter yarns generated a stronger contraction force. In addition, they found that the material used to make the balloon impacted the magnitude of the contraction and generated force.\"We found that we could tailor the material properties to the required performance of the device,\" said Xiaomeng Fang, assistant professor of textile engineering, chemistry and science at NC State. \"We also found that we can make this device small enough so we can potentially use it in fabric formation and other textile applications, including in wearables and assistive devices.\"In a follow-up study, researchers evaluated whether they could use the shape-changing fibers as a scaffold for fibroblasts, a cell type found in connective tissues that help support other tissues or organs.      \"The idea with stretching is to mimic the dynamic nature of how your body moves,\" said Jessica Gluck, assistant professor of textile engineering, chemistry and science at NC State, and a study co-author.They studied the cells' response to the motion of the shape-changing fibers, and to different materials used in the fibers' construction. They found the cells were able to cover and even penetrate the fiber robot's braiding sheath. However, they saw decreases in the cells' metabolic activity when the fiber robot's contraction extended beyond a certain level, compared to a device made of the same material that they kept stationary.The researchers are interested in building on the findings to see if they could use the fibers as a 3D biological model, and to investigate whether movement would impact cell differentiation. They said their model would be an advance over other existing experimental models that have been developed to show cellular response to stretching and other motion, since they can only move in two dimensions.\"Typically, if you want to add stretch or strain on cells, you would put them onto a plastic dish, and stretch them in one or two directions,\" Gluck said. \"In this study, we were able to show that in this 3D dynamic culture, the cells can survive for up to 72 hours.\"\"This is particularly useful for stem cells,\" Gluck added. \"What we could do in the future is look at what could happen at the cellular level with mechanical stress on the cells. You could look at muscle cells and see how they're developing, or see how the mechanical action would help differentiate the cells.\"The study \"Effect of Material Properties on Fiber-Shaped Pneumatic Actuators Performance\" was published in Actuators on March 18. Emily Petersen was a co-author.The study \"Development of a Pneumatic-Driven Fiber-Shaped Robot Scaffold for Use as a Complex 3D Dynamic Culture System\" was published online in Biomimetics on April 21.

    "text": "Earth's magnetic field, generated by the flow of molten iron in the planet's inner core, extends out into space and protects us from cosmic radiation emitted by the sun. It is also remarkably used by animals like salmon, sea turtles and migratory birds for navigation.          But how? And why? A new study from researchers at Western's Advanced Facility for Avian Research (AFAR), home to the world's first hypobaric climatic wind tunnel for bird flight, explores a brain region called cluster N that migratory birds use to perceive Earth's magnetic field. The team has discovered the region is activated very flexibly, meaning these birds have an ability to process, or ignore, geomagnetic information, just as you may attend to music when you are interested or tune it out when you are not.The findings were published in the European Journal of Neuroscience.Specifically, the research team led by psychology Ph.D. candidate Madeleine Brodbeck and AFAR co-director Scott MacDougall-Shackleton studied white-throated sparrows and found they were able to activate cluster N at night when they were motivated to migrate (to avoid prey and fly during cooler periods) and make it go dormant when they were resting at a stopover site.This is the first demonstration of this brain region functioning in a North American bird species, as all prior research in this area was completed in Europe.\"This brain region is super important for activating the geomagnetic compass, especially for songbirds when they migrate at night,\" said Brodbeck. \"Almost all previous work on this specific brain function was done at one lab in Europe, so it was great to replicate it in a North American bird like the white-throated sparrow.\"Earth's magnetic field, likely first investigated and identified by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in the 1830s, has long fascinated physicists, aerospace engineers and even science fiction writers like Frank Herbert and Stephen King. Brodbeck, a bird psychologist, is equally intrigued.\"Magnetic fields are really fun to think about because they're invisible to humans. We can't see them or sense them, but most animals perceive them in some way,\" said Brodbeck. \"For birds, using Earth's magnetic field to know if they're going towards a pole or towards the equator is obviously really helpful for orientation and migration. It's incredible that they can activate their brain in this way, and we can't.\"Understanding the physical mechanisms of how animals make their way around in the world is a fundamentally important question for researchers, says MacDougall-Shackleton, a psychology professor and cognitive neuroscientist.\"If we want to understand bird migration or how other animals move from one place to another, we need to know how they do it. And more importantly, we need to know what we're doing, as humans, that might influence them,\" said MacDougall-Shackleton.\"Birds don't just use their magnetic compass. We know they pay attention to the sun and the stars as cues too. And we also know that things like lights at night, or windows in buildings, and all these things that we put in the world disrupt their migrations,\" said MacDougall-Shackleton. \"This type of basic research informs us and lets us know the full suite of ways that animals perceive the world when they're migrating and what we as humans need to do to minimize our impact.\" More information:Madeleine I.

    "question_squad": " What is the most important determinant of personality differences between dog breeds?",
    "text": "The dog, man's best friend, is a popular pet. There are hundreds of different dog breeds, each of which is said to have a personality of their own. A study recently completed at the University of Helsinki confirms this notion of personality differences between dog breeds. The research is published in the journal iScience.          \"The breed of the dog is the most important determinant underlying personality differences. All dogs are individuals, and all breeds have different traits, but the breeds differ in what kind of personality most dogs within each breed have,\" says Postdoctoral Researcher Milla Salonen. While carrying out this study, Salonen worked as a researcher at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki. Currently she is active at the University of Turku's Department of Biology.Researchers from the canine gene research group at the University of Helsinki collected an enormous behavioral survey dataset encompassing more than 11,000 dogs, investigating environmental and other factors related to personality. The dataset included more than 300 different breeds, which were grouped into 52 breed groups. Up to now, differences between breeds have not been investigated in such a comprehensive manner. In fact, many of the breeds and breed groups have never been studied before.\"This study provides a topical update on the effect of the breed on the dog's personality, since in an American study published last year that effect was considered to be very minor. While the breed is the most important factor underlying personality, many genetic and non-genetic factors have a complex effect on personality,\" points out Professor Hannes Lohi from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.The study investigated the link between various factors to seven personality traits: insecurity, training focus, aggressiveness/dominance, energy, dog sociability, human sociability, and perseverance.Puppyhood socialization is important Of the environmental factors investigated in the study, socialization in puppyhood was the most significant. A large number of socialization experiences in puppyhood (between seven weeks and four months of age) were associated with the traits of lower insecurity and aggressiveness/dominance, as well as with higher training focus, and human and dog sociability.\"Our findings indicate that new owners should familiarize their puppies as much as possible with unfamiliar people, places and animals. Of course, socialization must always be done on the puppy's terms, which means that the puppy must not be forced into frightening situations,\" says Salonen.Age had a strong link to dogs' behavior. In older dogs, the mean for the training focus trait was higher than in young dogs. An opposite link was observed between age and insecurity, energy as well as human and dog sociability: in young dogs, the mean was higher.Complex personality traitsThe underlying factors investigated only accounted for a small part of the variation in personality traits between individuals. This and the substantial differences observed between breeds indicate that personality is also strongly genetic. Most likely, the environment of early puppyhood, including the care provided by the mother, is also of great importance, but this could not be determined in the study.\"Based on our research, personality traits are extremely complex and have astounding similarities between dogs, humans and other animals,\" Salonen says.

    "question_squad": " What is the most challenging stage of development?",
    "text": "Socializing is important for raising puppies into emotionally healthy dogs, just as caring for a puppy's growing needs is important to physical and mental health. In order to have a well-adjusted and social dog, owners should provide training specific to each stage of a puppy's development.          Harmony Diers, a veterinary technician at the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, provides ways to socialize puppies during the five stages of growth.In the neonatal stage, or the first two weeks of a puppy's life, Diers suggests owners gently hold their puppies for short periods of time to begin the socialization process. When puppies hit the transitional stage, between 2 and 4 weeks of age, they begin to socialize on their own by playing with their littermates. Diers recommends owners continue to hold their puppies in the transitional phase to assist in their socialization.Socialization stageOne of the most important stages in developing a dog's personality, according to Diers, is the socialization stage, which lasts between 3 and 12 weeks of age.\"Most of what puppies learn about socialization occurs in this stage,\" Diers said. \"Exposure to positive human interactions and new activities, situations and experiences will help puppies gain confidence in their interactions with a variety of people, objects, sounds and events.\"Examples of positive experiences include taking puppies on short car rides; introducing them to more toys and new objects, such as leashes and brushes; meeting new dogs and people; and exposing them to new environments.\"When meeting new dogs, it is important to ensure that the 'new' dog is friendly to avoid injuring the puppies; the new dog also should be vaccinated to avoid transmitting diseases or viruses,\" Diers said. \"In addition, when being exposed to new environments, unvaccinated puppies should avoid public settings, such as dog parks or pet supply stores, so that they are not susceptible to viruses and diseases. Instead, puppies can visit their own backyard or the house/yard of a friend or family member.\"During the socialization stage, puppies continue to play with their littermates and learn bite inhibition as well.\"Bite inhibition refers to a puppy learning how hard to bite their playmate based on the reaction they get from that playmate,\" Diers explained. \"As a puppy bites and wrestles with their littermates, the other puppy may yelp or recoil from the bite or play, indicating that the bite was too hard or the playing was too rough.\"Lastly, puppies become more aware of their relationship with humans in the beginning of the socialization stage, and by the end of the stage, their interest in bonding with humans increases.      Juvenile stageThe most challenging of developmental stages, however, is the juvenile stage, from 3 to 6 months of age.\"Puppies are learning their rank or position in their pack, so it will become more obvious which puppies are more outgoing and dominant or shy and submissive,\" Diers said. \"It is often this stage of development that determines the future behavior of a dog.\"Owners should be aware of certain behaviors\u2014such as aggression over food and objects or fear of new stimuli\u2014because puppies left to continue aggressive or fearful behaviors often grow into an adult with these behaviors, which can lead to a dog being rehomed or taken to a shelter.\"It is of vital importance for training and socialization to continue because puppies are very sensitive and receptive to behavior modifications during the juvenile stage, much more than an older puppy or adult dog,\" Diers said.Adolescent stageFinally, Diers emphasizes that training young dogs is crucial in the last development stage\u2014the adolescent stage, which occurs between 6 and 18 months of age\u2014because they are more capable of learning commands and tricks than in earlier phases.\"By adolescence, a puppy has an increased attention span and more hormones that will increase energy,\" Diers said. \"Training your puppy to channel that energy appropriately can reduce unwanted behaviors. In addition, it is great mental stimulation and social behavior practice to teach your puppy to work for things (sit, stay, shake hands, lay down, etc.). For example, teaching them to sit and wait before doing an action will help them focus on their owner's instruction, thus resulting in more polite behavior and a connection to their owner.\"Knowing how to socialize your furry friend throughout their time as a puppy can ensure that they adjust and become a happy and healthy lifelong member of your family.

    "text": "India's efforts to protect its endangered tigers have inadvertently helped avoid a large amount of climate change-causing carbon emissions by preventing deforestation, a study said on Thursday.          Three-quarters of the world's wild tigers live in India, but the destruction of their natural habitat have seen their numbers plummet.The number of tigers roaming the country's forests fell from 40,000 when India gained independence in 1947 to just 1,500 in 2006.However their number rose above 3,000 this year, according to the latest official figures.To help their numbers rebound, India has designated 52 tiger reserves where logging and deforestation are heavily regulated.Aakash Lamba, a researcher at the National University of Singapore and the new study's lead author, told AFP that tigers are an \"umbrella species\".This \"means that by protecting them we also protect the forests they live in, which are home to an incredible diversity of wildlife,\" he told AFP.Forests are a \"carbon sink\", which mean they absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release, making them a crucial tool in the fight against climate change.India, the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has pledged to lower its emissions.Million metric tonsLamba, who grew up in India, said the team of researchers sought to establish an empirical link between tiger conservation and carbon emissions.They compared the rate of deforestation in the special tiger reserves to areas where the big cats also live, but are less strictly protected.More than 61,000 hectares of forest was lost across 162 different areas between 2001 and 2020, according to the study.More than three quarters of the deforestation was in areas outside of the tiger reserves.Inside the tiger reserves, almost 6,000 hectares was saved from deforestation between 2007 to 2020. That equates to more than a million metric tons of carbon emissions avoided, the study estimated.Lamba emphasized the economic impact of those saved emissions in a country that has been hit hard by the effects of climate change\u2014particularly the agricultural industry.Taking into account the social cost of those emissions, more than $92 million had been saved, the researchers calculated.If counted as part of an carbon offset scheme, the avoided deforestation amounted to more than $6 million, they added.\"The financial benefits of avoiding carbon emissions are more than a quarter of the annual expenditure on tiger conservation in India,\" Lamba said.\"This significant outcome highlights how investments in wildlife conservation not only safeguard ecosystems and wildlife but also benefit societies and economies.\"The study was published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.The findings come after a study published in March suggested protecting or restoring a handful of wild animals such as whales, wolves and otters could help capture 6.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year.

    "text": "If we could rewind the tape of species evolution around the world and play it forward over hundreds of millions of years to the present day, we would see biodiversity clustering around regions of tectonic turmoil. Tectonically active regions such as the Himalayan and Andean mountains are especially rich in flora and fauna due to their shifting landscapes, which act to divide and diversify species over time.          But biodiversity can also flourish in some geologically quieter regions, where tectonics hasn't shaken up the land for millennia. The Appalachian Mountains are a prime example: The range has not seen much tectonic activity in hundreds of millions of years, and yet the region is a notable hotspot of freshwater biodiversity.Now, an MIT study identifies a geological process that may shape the diversity of species in tectonically inactive regions. In a paper appearing in Science, the researchers report that river erosion can be a driver of biodiversity in these older, quieter environments.They make their case in the southern Appalachians, and specifically the Tennessee River Basin, a region known for its huge diversity of freshwater fishes. The team found that as rivers eroded through different rock types in the region, the changing landscape pushed a species of fish known as the greenfin darter into different tributaries of the river network. Over time, these separated populations developed into their own distinct lineages.The team speculates that erosion likely drove the greenfin darter to diversify. Although the separated populations appear outwardly similar, with the greenfin darter's characteristic green-tinged fins, they differ substantially in their genetic makeup. For now, the separated populations are classified as one single species.\"Give this process of erosion more time, and I think these separate lineages will become different species,\" says Maya Stokes Ph.D. '21, who carried out part of the work as a graduate student in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).The greenfin darter may not be the only species to diversify as a consequence of river erosion. The researchers suspect that erosion may have driven many other species to diversify throughout the basin, and possibly other tectonically inactive regions around the world.\"If we can understand the geologic factors that contribute to biodiversity, we can do a better job of conserving it,\" says Taylor Perron, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at MIT.The study's co-authors include collaborators at Yale University, Colorado State University, the University of Tennessee, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Stokes is currently an assistant professor at Florida State University.      Fish in treesThe new study grew out of Stokes' Ph.D. work at MIT, where she and Perron were exploring connections between geomorphology (the study of how landscapes evolve) and biology. They came across work at Yale by Thomas Near, who studies lineages of North American freshwater fishes. Near uses DNA sequence data collected from freshwater fishes across various regions of North America to show how and when certain species evolved and diverged in relation to each other.Near brought a curious observation to the team: a habitat distribution map of the greenfin darter showing that the fish was found in the Tennessee River Basin\u2014but only in the southern half. What's more, Near had mitochondrial DNA sequence data showing that the fish's populations appeared to be different in their genetic makeup depending on the tributary in which they were found.To investigate the reasons for this pattern, Stokes gathered greenfin darter tissue samples from Near's extensive collection at Yale, as well as from the field with help from TVA colleagues. She then analyzed DNA sequences from across the entire genome, and compared the genes of each individual fish to every other fish in the dataset. The team then created a phylogenetic tree of the greenfin darter, based on the genetic similarity between fish.From this tree, they observed that fish within a tributary were more related to each other than to fish in other tributaries. What's more, fish within neighboring tributaries were more similar to each other than fish from more distant tributaries.\"Our question was, could there have been a geological mechanism that, over time, took this single species, and splintered it into different, genetically distinct groups?\" Perron says.A changing landscapeStokes and Perron started to observe a \"tight correlation\" between greenfin darter habitats and the type of rock where they are found. In particular, much of the southern half of the Tennessee River Basin, where the species abounds, is made of metamorphic rock, whereas the northern half consists of sedimentary rock, where the fish are not found.They also observed that the rivers running through metamorphic rock are steeper and more narrow, which generally creates more turbulence, a characteristic greenfin darters seem to prefer. The team wondered: Could the distribution of greenfin darter habitat have been shaped by a changing landscape of rock type, as rivers eroded into the land over time?To check this idea, the researchers developed a model to simulate how a landscape evolves as rivers erode through various rock types. They fed the model information about the rock types in the Tennessee River Basin today, then ran the simulation back to see how the same region may have looked millions of years ago, when more metamorphic rock was exposed.They then ran the model forward and observed how the exposure of metamorphic rock shrank over time. They took special note of where and when connections between tributaries crossed into non-metamorphic rock, blocking fish from passing between those tributaries.They drew up a simple timeline of these blocking events and compared this to the phylogenetic tree of diverging greenfin darters. The two were remarkably similar: The fish seemed to form separate lineages in the same order as when their respective tributaries became separated from the others.\"It means it's plausible that erosion through different rock layers caused isolation between different populations of the greenfin darter and caused lineages to diversify,\" Stokes says.

    "text": "Polar fish experience lower mortality than tropical fish, allowing them to delay reproduction until later in life when they are larger and can produce more eggs, according to a study by Mariana \u00c1lvarez-Noriega at Monash University in Australia and colleagues, publishing May 25 in the open access journal PLOS Biology. This may have implications for the effects of climate change on the sustainability of fish populations.          Organisms face a trade-off around when is the best time to reproduce. Fish continue to grow throughout life and larger fish tend to produce disproportionately more eggs than smaller fish, so it pays to reproduce later in life. However, fish that mature slowly risk dying before they reach reproductive age. Therefore, life history theory predicts that the age at which a fish starts reproducing should be influenced by the species' growth rate and mortality risk.To test this hypothesis, researchers applied an existing mathematical model of life history evolution to published data on weight at birth, growth rate, and adult mortality for 47 species of marine fish. They found that tropical fish experience 80% higher mortality than polar fish. The model predicted that polar fish should take advantage of their lower mortality risk to maximize the number of offspring they produce by maturing later in life.Published data on marine fishes confirmed the model's predictions: polar species tend to reproduce significantly later than tropical ones and the number of eggs they produce increases more steeply as body size increases. As a result, polar fishes tend to produce more eggs than tropical fishes.These findings suggest that climate change could drive shifts in growth and reproduction in marine fishes, with warmer oceans causing fish to reproduce earlier in life when they are smaller in size, and producing fewer eggs as a result. This could have a major impact on fish populations and fisheries worldwide, the authors say.\u00c1lvarez-Noriega adds, \"We tested predictions from a life-history optimization model with a global dataset of marine fish demography and found that reductions in mortality at high latitudes result in delayed maturation and a steeper size-fecundity relationship.\" More information:Life history optimisation drives latitudinal gradients and responses to global change in marine fishes, PLoS Biology (2023).

    "text": "A groundbreaking study has revealed that plants can efficiently remove toxic petrol fumes, including cancer-causing compounds such as benzene, from indoor air.          The study was led by University of Technology Sydney (UTS) bioremediation researcher Associate Professor Fraser Torpy, in partnership with leading plantscaping solutions company Ambius.The researchers found that the Ambius small green wall, containing a mix of indoor plants, was highly effective at removing harmful, cancer-causing pollutants, with 97% of the most toxic compounds removed from the surrounding air in just eight hours.Poor indoor air quality is responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization. Most people spend 90% of their time indoors at home, school or the workplace, so adopting new strategies to improve air quality is critical.Ambius General Manager Johan Hodgson said the research presented new evidence into the critical role played by indoor plants and green walls in cleaning the air we breathe quickly and sustainably.\"We know that indoor air quality is often significantly more polluted than outdoor air, which in turn impacts mental and physical health. But the great news is this study has shown that something as simple as having plants indoors can make a huge difference,\" Mr. Hodgson said.Previous studies on indoor plants have shown they can remove a broad range of indoor air contaminants, however this is the first study into the ability of plants to clean up petrol vapors, which are one of the largest sources of toxic compounds in buildings worldwide.Offices and residential apartment buildings often connect directly to car parks, either by doors or lift wells, making it difficult to avoid harmful petrol-related compounds seeping into work and residential areas. Many buildings are also exposed to petrol fumes from nearby roads and highways.Breathing petrol fumes can lead to lung irritation, headaches and nausea, and has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, asthma and other chronic diseases from longer term exposure, contributing to decreased life expectancy.Associate Professor Torpy said the study results, based on measurements from a sealed chamber, had far exceeded their expectations when it came to removing petrol pollutants from the air.\"This is the first time plants have been tested for their ability to remove petrol-related compounds, and the results are astounding.\"Not only can plants remove the majority of pollutants from the air in a matter of hours, they remove the most harmful petrol-related pollutants from the air most efficiently, for example, known carcinogen benzene is digested at a faster rate than less harmful substances, like alcohols.\"We also found that the more concentrated the toxins in the air, the faster and more effective the plants became at removing the toxins, showing that plants adapt to the conditions they're growing in,\" Associate Professor Torpy said.Mr. Hodgson said the findings confirmed feedback they'd received after installing plants in hundreds of office buildings across the nation.\"At Ambius, we see over and over again the effects plants have in improving health, well-being, productivity and office attendance for the thousands of businesses we work with. This new research proves that plants should not just be seen as 'nice to have,' but rather a crucial part of every workplace wellness plan.\"The bottom line is that the best, most cost effective and most sustainable way to combat harmful indoor air contaminants in your workplace and home is to introduce plants,\" Mr. Hodgson said.

    "question_squad": " What is the biggest problem with potatoes?",
    "text": ",If you've been into a fish and chip shop in the last 12 months, you may well have seen a notice tacked to the wall about the impact of the potato shortage. Supermarkets, too, slapped temporary limits on frozen chip purchases.          What was behind it? Wet weather, floods\u2014and highly persistent fungal diseases. Growers in Tasmania were worst hit, with mainland growers in New South Wales and Victoria also hit.Even 175 years after Ireland's devastating famine caused by an introduced potato blight, we're still struggling to combat these diseases. That's a problem, because potatoes are vital. More than a billion of us eat them regularly. They're the fourth most important staple food after rice, wheat and corn, and the largest non-cereal crop.Diseases such as pink rot and powdery scab can live in the soil for years. They're almost impossible to eradicate down there. When there's a sudden pulse of water, they spread and can destroy entire fields of potatoes.What we can do is be better prepared. Our research team is monitoring soil moisture and temperature levels to help us predict whether we're likely to see an outbreak. This knowledge could let growers respond quickly with fungicide or stopping irrigation to slow or prevent a severe outbreak.So what caused the shortage?In the lead-up to Christmas last year, Australia had a major potato shortage.Our main growing regions in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia were hard hit by flooding and heavy rain due to La Ni\u00f1a, which created conditions ripe for potato diseases to spread. Waterlogged or diseased potatoes cannot be sold.Other issues included delays to harvesting and planting due to the weather. And the skyrocketing costs of fuel and fertilizer have forced some growers not to plant potatoes. Potatoes need a lot of fertilizer and water.While you might associate these tubers with snack foods, in reality they're highly nutritious and an important source of complex carbohydrates.The way we grow them is very efficient. The amount of food energy we get per hectare of potatoes is many times greater than other staples like rice and wheat.Stored properly, potatoes can last up to eight months.Many growers find them to be one of the most profitable crops they can grow\u2014as long as they're prepared to face risks such as disease.      What's next for our potato sector?With the major rains at an end for now, potatoes are returning to the shelves and frozen food section.But potato lovers aren't out of the woods yet. For producers, there are still many worries. The increasing costs of production in fertilizer and other inputs. The chance of renewed heavy rainfall. And the continual battle against soil-borne disease.Take Tasmania's growers, who produce almost a third (31%) of Australia's potatoes.Unexpectedly wet soil conditions in spring last year forced many growers to delay planting until after mid-November.Planting after this date comes with a cost. It means that by the time the plants mature, Tasmania will be through summer and into cooler months, reducing available sunlight and growing temperatures. That can mean a lower yield.Facing delays like this, growers often simply don't plant a crop at all. But because of the shortages, Tasmania's major processing companies offered a bonus to encourage a late crop to ensure factories could keep running.The eternal fight against diseaseEver since potatoes emerged from the Andes to become a global crop, growers have battled the threat of soil-borne fungal and bacterial diseases.Backyard gardeners may well be familiar with some of these. If you've ever pulled up a potato plant only to find a half-rotten tater, you'll know the disappointment.What keeps Australian growers up at night are diseases like powdery scab, as well as rot diseases like black leg, soft rot and pink rot.Powdery scab is mainly a cosmetic issue, turning nice-looking potatoes into unappetising, lesion-covered blobs.But rot is real trouble. These bacteria and fungi can destroy entire fields.Pink rot is heavily influenced by free water in the soil. Heavy rainfalls just before an autumn harvest have triggered major rot epidemics with significant losses to growers in three of Tasmania's last five growing seasons.In severe cases, growers have to abandon fields with the tubers left to rot away, while in less severe cases there's still substantial loss of crop and lower product quality.If we see these levels of unprecedented rainfall again\u2014as is likely with climate changes warping weather patterns\u2014we're like to see more potato shortages.So what can growers do? For pink rot and powdery scab disease, we don't have good options. There are a few disease-resistant varieties, but their resistance comes at the cost of desirable properties like crop yield and how well they cook. Chemical controls are limited, and if we overuse them, we risk these fungi developing resistance just as bacteria do with antibiotics.Fungi and bacteria can lie dormant for many years or stay alive on other plant species between crops. That limits how effective crop rotation is as a tool.Cropping land proven to be pathogen free is in very short supply. Food industries which rely on potatoes are compensating for these expected losses by contracting a greater number of growers and over-planting.But it's not a hopeless case. We and other researchers are working on it. Recently, we made a new tool to help rapidly spot powdery scab disease in new potato varieties.Now we're working on ways to track changes in soil moisture and temperature against rot and powdery scab outbreaks. This, we hope, will let us predict outbreaks before they occur.Sometimes, you don't have to defeat a disease outright. Better prediction and containment may be enough to keep us supplied with hot chips. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Of the 610 species collected, many had existing genetic data, but the researchers produced new RNA sequences for the transcriptomes\u2014the collection of all genes expressed by an organism\u2014of 431 species. The specimens included representatives from all five orchid subfamilies, 19 of 22 tribes, 44 of 51 subtribes, and 297 genera\u2014the level of classification just above species. They compared the sequence of 1,450 genes among the 610 species to reconstruct the orchid family tree.\"There have been several previous studies with fewer species and not as much representation of the various subgroups within the orchid family,\" said Ma. \"Our larger study allowed us to fill several gaps in the orchid family tree and clarify relationships among orchids.\"Orchids grow primarily in rainforests and most, around 70%, grow on other plants, rather than in the soil on the forest floor. This ability, which is also found in plants like mosses and some ferns, may give them an advantage for growth by exposing them to sunlight, water and pollinators where there is less competition from other plants. Growers of orchids at home will know that they are potted on tree bark rather than soil.Most of the epiphytic orchids are found in two of the five orchid subfamilies, but it was unclear how many times the trait might have evolved independently in these lineages. Because the orchid family is so large, to get a clear picture of how trait evolved required the large number of species used in this study, including greater representation of species from many of the finer branches of the family tree.\"We invested a great deal of time and energy to produce genetic data for over 400 additional species of orchids, which allowed us to be confident in our representation of the relationships among the species\u2014which are more closely related and which are more distant\u2014and to reconstruct where in the family tree epiphytism evolved,\" said Ma. \"Based on our data, we can see that epiphytism evolved independently at least 14 times. One of these was shared by about 95% of epiphytic orchids and occurred 55 million years ago, supporting the formation of modern rainforests a short time after the extinction of dinosaurs.\"The rainforests where orchids grow are incredibly important for their biodiversity and epiphytic orchids can account for up to 50% of the plant diversity in rainforests.\"Understanding the relationships among orchid species can help us with conservation efforts, with future studies into the evolution of orchid traits, and for identifying new potential uses for orchids,\" said Ma.

    "text": "While invasive alien species (IAS) represent a growing threat to global biodiversity and ecosystems, public awareness of them hasn't seen a significant increase. Many researchers believe informing people about IAS is an essential long-term investment to counter biological invasions; in particular, \"learning by doing\" is an extremely effective method for involving new audiences, such as students.          About 500 Italian students aged 11-18 took part in a citizen science project that led to new geographical records of two alien species of ambrosia beetles considered to be quarantine pests by the European Union. Dr. Fernanda Colombari and Prof. Andrea Battisti of the University of Padova have described the results in a paper in NeoBiota.The project involved schools located in urban areas in north-eastern Italy and aimed to connect environmental education and experiential outdoor learning through lectures, videos, reports, and large-scale surveillance of ambrosia beetles. The students used plastic bottles and hand sanitizer to trap ambrosia beetles in their school grounds. They then assessed their abundance, looking at the different species. Before and after the educational activities, their knowledge and awareness of IAS were tested using simple anonymous questionnaires.\"Our study aimed to both educate students and collect scientific data at sites such as schools where surveillance for potentially invasive ambrosia beetles is not usually conducted, or where it is sometimes misunderstood,\" Dr. Colombari and Prof. Battisti write in their paper.Identifying the specimens collected by the students, the authors found that IAS amounted to 35% of total catches. Remarkably, two out of the four alien species caught, Cnestus mutilatus and Anisandrus maiche, were recorded for the first time in Europe thanks to this study.Furthermore, questionnaire results showed that the students acquired greater knowledge and increased their awareness and interest in IAS by more than 50%. After the experiment, most of them were interested in learning more about the negative effects of the introduction of IAS and practices to limit their spread.This study shows that citizen science can successfully involve school students, giving them an opportunity to contribute in an effective early detection of IAS, as most first records occur in cities or suburban areas. The results also point to the primary role of education, which is as a major driver of change in tackling sustainability challenges. Moreover, as students bring home the message and share it with their relatives, the process supports intergenerational learning and enlarges public collaboration.\"People are often unaware of the role they have in the entire invasive process,\" the researchers write in their study. Citizen science projects like this one are more than a reliable tool for collecting scientific data; they also help engage the public and spread awareness of biological invasions, eventually contributing to the creation of more efficient management strategies.The monitoring program in this study was conducted in the context of the European project HOMED (Holistic management of emerging forest pests and diseases), which has developed a full panel of scientific knowledge and practical solutions for the management of emerging native and non-native pests and pathogens threatening European forests.

    "question_squad": " What is the lifespan of a Greenland shark?",
    "text": "If a fishery manager could only know one thing about a fish species, it should be lifespan. But many species live out their lives on time scales much longer than we can observe. And even the short-lived species do a good job of hiding in the sea.          That's why researchers have developed a model to predict the lifespan of any fish species. They are a very diverse and numerous group. Bony fish alone comprise nearly 30,000 species, around half of all vertebrates. All we need to know to predict lifespan for any fish species is the genome sequence of a single individual.One fish, two fish, old fish, new fishKnown lifespans of fish species range from less than one year for the pygmy goby to nearly 400 years for the Greenland shark. However, the Greenland shark's genome hasn't been sequenced yet, so we can't tell you for sure.Dr. Alyssa Budd is a postdoc with our Environomics Future Science Platform (FSP). She said lifespan can be used to help estimate sustainable harvests, extinction risk and even the invasion potential of a pest species.\"For example, we know long-lived species are likely to take a long time to reach sexual maturity. They have fewer offspring, with more investment in those offspring. This means we can roughly estimate things like the population growth rate of a species just from knowing its lifespan,\" Alyssa said.\"The problem is, we don't know lifespan for most fish species. And rules of thumb that typically work for mammals, like small body equals short lifespan, are much more complicated in fish. Even in closely related species lifespan can vary greatly. For example, the lifespan of different species of rockfish can range from about 10 years to over 200 years.\"Estimating lifespanAlong with lifespan, the actual ages of individuals in a population are important to know for species management.That's why previously our Environomics FSP developed a computational model to predict lifespan in mammals and other vertebrates and a DNA test to find out the ages of individual fish using only a tiny piece of fin tissue.The lifespan prediction model uses a species genome sequence, sifting through the combinations of A, G, C and T to count the number of C-G sequences in gene promoters. These are the regions of DNA that determine if a gene becomes active or not. C-G sequences act like on/off switches and the number of C-G switches relates to how slowly the species ages.Alyssa and her team from CSIRO and Curtin University have now expanded the lifespan model to apply more accurately to fish. Their research is published in the journal Molecular Ecology Resources.\"We added hundreds more fish species into the model. We also used gene promoter sequences that are fish-specific. Because these regions can be hard to find in the genome if you're trying to match them with a distantly related species,\" Alyssa said.\"We trained our model on fish species with known lifespans. And now we can put the genome of any fish species into the model to estimate its lifespan.\"Most genomes are available online in public databases, and there's been an explosion of species genomes published in the last few years. We only need one genome, of almost any quality, to predict the lifespan of a species.\" More information:Alyssa M.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the bacteria that causes gastrointestinal infections?",
    "text": "While we humans generally experience the world through sight, dogs use scent to learn about the environment around them. What their nose knows is crucial for finding food, mates and safe spaces.          Our furry friends can also use their sniffing power to learn how people are feeling. For example, they can detect the scent of fear in human sweat.Given this, it's perhaps not surprising that pooches' super-smelling skills can extend to monitoring human health\u2014including, potentially, by detecting infectious diseases such as COVID. In a recent study undertaken in Californian schools, dogs were found to detect the virus with 95% sensitivity in a controlled laboratory setting and 83% in schools.The olfactory capability of dogs far exceeds our own. Estimates suggest that dogs' smelling ability might be up to 10,000 times better than ours, thanks to having more than 100 million scent receptors in their nose (compared to six million in people). Dogs can detect a wide range of different smells at much lower concentrations than humans or even hi-tech laboratory instruments\u2014sometimes as low as at one part per trillion.Interestingly, dogs use their nostrils separately. They start sniffing with their right nostril, and if the smell is familiar and \"safe,\" they switch to using their left nostril.Dogs differ in the shape and size of their noses, of course, but all have an impressive ability to detect scent in a range of situations. And not only are dogs good at sniffing, they love to do it. Allowing dogs to sniff can actually improve their welfare and make them more optimistic.      Pandemic partnersDogs have shown they can accurately identify a variety of infectious diseases via scent. For example, children infected with malaria parasites were successfully identified by dogs sniffing their foot odor. Dogs can also detect bacterial urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections caused by the bacteria Clostridium difficle, which can be life-threatening in vulnerable patients.Early in the COVID pandemic, it became clear that there was a need for extensive, real-time, accurate detection of infection. Respiratory infections cause the release of a range of substances that each have their own distinct smell.Given dogs' success in detecting other infectious diseases, the potential role of dogs as \"lab partners\" during the pandemic was quickly explored.Initial research revealed that after just one week of training on COVID-specific odor, dogs were able to identify infections in bodily fluids from the respiratory system, correctly identifying positive cases 83% of the time. Once trained on respiratory samples, dogs were also capable of generalizing their COVID detection skills to other bodily fluids, such as sweat and urine.The potential for real-time screening with a high degree of sensitivity offers several advantages over traditional COVID testing methods, such as lateral flow and PCR testing, including cost and efficiency.Screening by sniffingIn the recent study, two dogs already trained to detect the scent of COVID in the lab were taken into 27 Californian schools and completed 3,897 screenings, mostly among students, by sniffing their ankles and feet. For comparison and to check accuracy of detection, participants also undertook lateral flow tests.After initial training, the dogs were detecting the virus in the lab with 95% sensitivity (correctly identifying positive cases) and 95% specificity (correctly identifying those who did not have COVID).Screening people directly saw a slight drop in sensitivity to 83% and specificity to 90%. This is slightly lower than some estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of lateral flow tests, though their reported effectiveness has varied in different studies and between tests.But even considering that the dogs made a small number of errors, given that screening could be completed within seconds, efficiency was high.In the same way that dogs routinely screen people for substances such as drugs or explosives as part of safety and security measures, they could offer effective medical screening services too. In high throughput environments such as schools or colleges, fast and effective screening would have distinct advantages.However, all medical and health technology needs to be thoroughly evaluated for safety, cost and effectiveness, as well as any legal and ethical implications. Widespread health screening using dogs similarly requires ongoing review and careful consideration, while also ensuring the welfare of the dogs.Doctor dog?COVID is just one medical condition our canine companions could potentially help detect.Along with infectious diseases, they have successfully detected certain forms of cancer in biological samples, the onset of epileptic seizures, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in diabetes patients.Dogs and humans have lived together for thousands of years, and dogs have become constant human companions in many parts of the world.The fact that they love to sniff, and are so good at it, has also made them important working partners in a range of roles. Using their innate skills to support human health and well-being through medical detection might be another way by which the human-dog relationship is deepened.

    "text": "A new study, published on May 25, 2023 in Frontiers in Plant Science by researchers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and partners, has identified that the use of machine learning could speed up the search for plants with antimalarial properties.          Malaria is one of humankind's deadliest diseases and remains a significant global public health challenge. Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is spread to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. In 2021, the World Health Organization found that there were an estimated 247 million cases of malaria worldwide. Resistance to existing antimalarial drugs is an escalating challenge for eliminating malaria and, as a result, the WHO recommends that research into antimalarial medicines should be accelerated as part of an effort to reach global malaria targets.Plants have provided or inspired the development of numerous pharmaceutical drugs as they are a rich source of bioactive compounds. For example, two major pharmaceutical drugs used in the treatment of malaria, quinine and artemisinin, are derived from plants. However, considering that there are an estimated 343,000 vascular plant species, identifying plants containing anti-Plasmodium compounds can be time-consuming and costly.As part of the new study, scientists aimed to assess whether machine learning models could be trained on plant trait data to predict the anti-Plasmodium activity of plants. To do this they studied three flowering plant families\u2014Apocynaceae, Loganiaceae and Rubiaceae\u2014together constituting 21,100 species. Researchers explored an array of methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms and compared their performance with other approaches often used to select plants to find sources of bioactive compounds.                Cinchona L. (Rubiaceae) is native to Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panam\u00e1, Peru and Venezuela, and has been introduced to other parts of the globe. Credit: Alexandre Antonelli RBG Kew             The experts found that the techniques provide a promising approach to improve the ability to predict plants with anti-Plasmodium properties, which could greatly accelerate the search for new compounds of pharmaceutical interest. Researchers estimate that 7,677 species in the three families warrant further investigation and that at least 1,300 active anti-Plasmodium species may have been missed using conventional approaches.      Adam Richard-Bollans, Research Fellow at RBG Kew, said, \"Our results highlight the vast unexplored potential of plants to produce novel medicines. There are an estimated 343,000 known vascular plant species that remain largely unexplored scientifically, and we hope that our machine learning approach can be employed to efficiently search these plants for new medicinal compounds. These results also reinforce the importance of protecting biodiversity and using natural resources sustainably in order to preserve this valuable resource.\"Daniele Silvestro, University of Fribourg and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Group Leader, said, \"Our study shows that machine learning offers the tools to combine scientific knowledge of plants and their traditional uses into a powerful predictive framework that can guide future testing and research. Biodiversity likely holds solutions to existing and future global health issues, and machine learning coupled with continued rigorous research in biology can help unlocking this potential.\" More information:Adam Richard-Bollans et al, Machine learning enhances prediction of plants as potential sources of antimalarials, Frontiers in Plant Science (2023).

    "text": "A slow birthrate and night-time wanderings of pregnant gray nurse sharks away from no-take marine protected areas are putting the fierce-looking but mild-mannered species at further risk of extinction.          A 10-year study that tagged and tracked 34 gray nurse sharks migrating between the Great Barrier Reef and southern New South Wales identified the double threat for the critically endangered species, which has only about 400 breeding animals left in the wild.The collaborative research led by Dr. Ross Dwyer of the University of the Sunshine Coast and Dr. Carley Kilpatrick from the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) found the migratory sharks regularly visited no-take MPAs established along the east coast of Australia.This included Wolf Rock, northeast of Double Island Point; Flat Rock north of North Stradbroke Island; and Henderson Rock and Cherubs Cave, east of Moreton Island.All are popular spots for scuba diving tourism in Queensland, with the gray nurse shark not considered a risk to human safety.Dr. Dwyer, a UniSC animal ecology academic, said Flat Rock, Henderson Rock and Cherubs Cave were used for several weeks each year (during winter\u2014early summer) by migrating male and female sharks.\"In contrast, Wolf Rock was particularly important for pregnant female sharks which would stay at the site for up to 254 days during their gestation. However, sharks regularly left the relative safety of the MPAs, often in darkness,\" Dr. Dwyer said.\"These excursions will likely increase the risk of them becoming bycatch\u2014getting accidentally caught in commercial or recreational fisheries or in shark control equipment along beaches.\"The findings were published this month in the journal Biological Conservation, in a paper co-authored by nine partners from The University of Queensland, QPWS, NSW Department of Primary industries, Sydney Institute of Marine Science, and Macquarie University.One of the tracked female sharks was initially captured as an immature shark in August 2015, after she was observed by members of the public off North Stradbroke Island with a stainless-steel rod protruding through her stomach.Following surgery and a period of rehab at Sea World Gold Coast, she was detected five years later with fresh mating scars at Cherubs Cave enroute to Wolf Rock.Dr. Kilpatrick, a Senior Conservation Officer and gray nurse shark expert with QPWS, said Wolf Rock was the only known gestation site for the Australian east coast gray nurse population.\"These night-time excursions suggest the existing no-take MPA at Wolf Rock needs to be larger to protect sharks in areas we now know they use, and help ensure the species' long-term conservation,\" Dr. Kilpatrick said.\"The tracking also revealed a longer than expected three-year migratory cycle linked to breeding. This slow reproductive rate, with females not breeding until they are at least nine years old and having a maximum of two pups at a time, highlights why the population has been so slow to recover.\"The research highlights how our no-take MPAs do a great job of protecting gray nurse sharks while they congregate in them.

    "question_squad": " What is the main cause of the mass extinction?",
    "text": "The end of the Triassic period, 201 million years ago, is considered one of the greatest mass extinction events in the history of the Earth. The main cause of this catastrophe for life and evolution is thought to have been intense volcanism in Siberia. This led to worldwide climatic turbulence and acidification of the sea water.          Among sea creatures, ammonites and nautilids were particularly affected. Until now, it was assumed that only a single genus of each of the two groups survived this period of crisis and that all subsequent diversity of species evolved from these two surviving lineages. This idea has now been revised due to the examination and re-evaluation of an extraordinary 185-million-year-old nautilid from the middle Early Jurassic of Behla near Donaueschingen, Germany.The fossil has been in the collection of the Stuttgart Natural History Museum since 1975. Dr. G\u00fcnter Schweigert, paleontologist at the museum, has now researched the fossil nautilus and described it in the  journal Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Geologie und Pal\u00e4ontologie as a new species, Germanonautilus warthi.Valuable new insights for the evolution of the nautilidsNautilids are generally much rarer than those of ammonites and many fossil species are only known from chance finds. This makes the discovery of Germanonautilus warthi all the more valuable for experts. The fossil revises the evolutionary scenario at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary from the 1950s, which dates back to the American paleontologist and nautilid researcher Bernhard Kummel (1919-1980).\"The specimen clearly belongs to Germanonautilus, a genus that was widespread worldwide in the Triassic period. For a period of 15 million years, there is no evidence of Germanonautilus, but the genus, together with other nautilids, must have survived the crisis at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary somewhere,\" says Dr. G\u00fcnter Schweigert. The new species therefore provides valuable new clues to the evolution of nautilids.Significance of the find remained hidden for a long timeThe curator in charge made the find in the 1970s during field work and classified the specimen in the collection. Since the fossil had not yet been prepared at the time, Germanonautilus warthi was thought to be a representative of Cenoceras, the genus to which almost all nautilids from the Lower Jurassic period belonged. Since Jurassic nautilids had not been scientifically revised for decades, the significance of the find remained hidden until now.\"Some shell features of Germanonautilus also suggest that a quite successful family of younger Jurassic nautilids has its direct roots to this genus, but the traditional assumption that all post-Triassic nautilids go back to Cenoceras clouded this view,\" says Dr. G\u00fcnter Schweigert. The paleontologist is sure that the new findings can provide valuable clues for future studies on the evolution of prehistoric and present-day marine fauna.Unlike the ammonites, the nautilids have survived until today, but are currently severely threatened by overfishing and habitat destruction.

    "question_squad": " What is the process in which stem cells are converted to more specialized types?",
    "text": "The many types of cells in the human body are produced through the process of differentiation, in which stem cells are converted to more specialized types. Currently, it is challenging for researchers to control the differentiation of stem cells in the lab (in vitro). Of particular interest are oocytes, which are female germ cells that develop into eggs. Understanding their development could have far-ranging impacts, from infertility treatment to conservation of endangered species.          A new study by a Japanese team of researchers led by Dr. Mitinori Saitou has successfully induced meiotic (dividing) oocytes from the embryonic stem cells of cynomolgus monkeys, which share many physiological traits with humans. By establishing a culture method for inducing the differentiation of meiotic oocytes, the researchers aimed to shed light on germ cell development in both humans and other primates. The study's findings were published in The EMBO Journal.The team previously reported conditions for inducing oogonia, the precursors of oocytes, by aggregating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) with cells from the ovaries of female mouse embryos and then culturing them under air\u2013liquid interface conditions. Similarly, PGCLCs from cynomolgus monkey were induced to differentiate into oogonia but did not progress to meiotic oocytes.To overcome this hurdle, the induced oogonia were isolated and re-aggregated with somatic cells from the ovaries of female mouse embryos and cultured again.Under these new culture conditions, the cynomolgus monkey oogonia were successfully induced to differentiate into meiotic oocytes, but their development stopped at the second stage of meiosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis showed that the transcriptomic dynamics of the oocytes in vitro (in the lab) were similar to those of oocytes in vivo (in our body).The researchers also identified differences in gene expression between the in vitro and in vivo oocytes, which suggested a bottleneck for in vitro oocyte development that might lead to the arrest of meiosis in vitro.Furthermore, by performing whole-genome methylome analysis, the authors found that the induced oocytes were involved in the genome-wide demethylation process in vitro, as seen in mouse and human female germ cell development. They also noticed that demethylation behaved differently in paternally and maternally-derived X chromosomes.These unique methylation dynamics were also found in human oogonia induced in vitro, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying female germ cell development may be the same across primate species. Thus, this culture system might be useful as a model of the primate germ cell differentiation process.Asked about the potential impact of their study, the authors said that their method of reconstituting multiple steps in the development of female germ cells may help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of primate oocyte development and could one day contribute to the treatment of impaired oocyte development in reproductive medicine.First author Dr. Sayuri Gyobu-Motani says, \"We hope that that our culture system can aid in the conservation of endangered species and the creation of in vitro oocyte induction systems for other mammalian species with long lifespans.\" More information:Sayuri Gyobu\u2010Motani et al, Induction of fetal meiotic oocytes from embryonic stem cells in cynomolgus monkeys, The EMBO Journal (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the trick that fruit flies use to keep their wings up in the air?",
    "text": "Researchers at the Institute for Theoretical Biology at Humboldt Universit\u00e4t have solved a long-standing mathematical puzzle about the emergence of electrical activity patterns during insect flight. Together with colleagues at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, they report a novel function for electrical synapses in governing the flight of fruit flies in the current issue of Nature.          To keep their small bodies up in the air, fruit flies have to beat their wings extremely fast. They use a trick that is widespread in the animal kingdom: their nerve cells do not keep pace with the flapping of their wings. In order to control the flight muscles, each nerve cell instead generates an electrical pulse\u2014also called action potential\u2014only about every twentieth wing beat. This action potential, however, is precisely tuned to interact with other nerve cells. In a small circuit consisting of a few nerve cells, special activity patterns are generated: each cell regularly fires pulses, yet not at the same time as the other cells but rather spread out asynchronously at fixed intervals relative to each other.In the fruit fly, such activity patterns have been known since the 1970s. Until now, their emergence was attributed to a connectivity of the nerve cells via chemical synapses. It was assumed that inhibitory messenger substances between nerve cells are released in response to action potentials, mutually preventing the cells from generating pulses at the same time.Using mathematical analysis, however, Prof. Susanne Schreiber's team has now been able to show that such pulse-distributed activity can also occur when the nerve cells are not connected chemically, but electrically\u2014that is, without the use of messenger substances. In this case, the cells have to use a special kind of action potential that comes along with a high sensitivity to the inputs from others, especially when a cell has just been active. This type of sensitivity is not typical of \"normal\" action potentials and, therefore, in the latter case no pulse-distributed activity is to be expected if the cellular coupling is purely electrical.Experimental evidence for the type of pulse generation predicted by the Berlin researchers was provided by Prof. Carsten Duch's research group in Mainz. The scientists strengthened or weakened certain ionic currents in the cells of the fruit fly in order to change the type of action potentials that were generated. They were able to show that these manipulations influenced the activity patterns in the flight circuit exactly as predicted by the mathematical model. In addition, they proved that the connections among cells are indeed electrical and that knocking down this coupling has the expected effects on the activity patterns and wing beats of the animals.The finding of the teams in Berlin and Mainz is particularly surprising, as it had so far been assumed that electrical coupling serves to promote the simultaneous activity of nerve cells. The activity patterns arising from electrical synapses reveal new principles of information processing in nervous systems. The same mechanism could be used not only in thousands of other insect species but also in the human brain, where the function of electrical coupling is still far from being understood.

    "question_squad": " What is the complex of DNA and protein tightly compacted inside cells?",
    "text": "When a cell divides, it retains information about how to grow and instructions about what type of cell to become. Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have gained a new understanding of how these processes can work, revealing a previously unappreciated role for the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The study was published May 24 in Nature.          When a cell undergoes differentiation, stem cells (the earliest cells that develop) undergo changes that transform them into a different type of cell, typically one with a more specialized function (such as a skin or muscle cell). As cells divide, they must retain the \"memory\" of their current differentiation state to transfer the proper identity to the daughter cells.Chromatin is a complex of DNA and protein tightly compacted inside cells. Chromatin must unwind to turn genes on and off in closely regulated processes. SWI/SNF complexes control a cell's identity during differentiation by changing chromatin architecture to regulate gene expression. However, it was unknown whether SWI/SNF complexes contribute to the memory of cell identity during cell division.Cancers often carry mutations that affect the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. One example is the loss of the core subunit SMARCB1. Other studies have also linked mutations in the complex to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, scientists at St. Jude have discovered how subunits of SWI/SNF act as \"bookmarks\" during mitosis to safeguard cell identity during division. The work points to the importance of SWI/SNF core subunits SMARCE1 and SMARCB1 and their roles in the process.\"This work provides an understanding of a new component of mitotic memory, as well as provides clues to why a mutation of this SWI/SNF complex subunit would disrupt memory of what a cell should normally be doing and allow it to go into a cancerous state,\" said senior author Charles W.M. Roberts, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President and St. Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center director.SWI/SNF subunits help cells 'remember'Previously, researchers believed the enzymatically active subunit of the SWI/SNF complex was not bound to DNA in mitosis, so scientists have assumed that SWI/SNF complexes had no role during mitosis. In launching this study, Roberts wondered, \"If a piece of this complex is mutated, how can a cancer cell remember to be a cancer cell coming out on the other side of mitosis? What is the memory mechanism sustaining the cancer cell?\"Surprisingly, Roberts's team found that two individual subunits of SWI/SNF complexes, but not the rest of the complex, bind to mitotic DNA. They then showed that the binding of SMARCE1 and SMARCB1 is required for the appropriate reactivation of bound genes after mitosis.Further experiments, which removed SMARCE1 during mitosis, found that loss of SMARCE1 disrupts gene expression, impairs the ability of some other \"bookmarks\" to bind to their targets and causes abnormal neural differentiation. These findings suggest that SMARCE1 plays a mitotic bookmarking role and is essential for the retention of appropriate differentiation programming during mitosis.\"In a normal cell, SMARCB1 would be bound in mitosis to bookmark the genes that should be turned on after the cell divides,\" Roberts said. \"But SMARCB1 is deleted in nearly all cases of a highly lethal type of cancer that strikes young children called rhabdoid tumors. Consequently cell identity genes fail to turn on immediately after a cell divides. This may be a key component that enables the cells to stay in a cancerous state, as they fail to activate the genes that normally help them differentiate.\"      Implications beyond pediatric cancerPrevious work showed that SWI/SNF subunit abnormalities exist in approximately 20% of all cancers. Additionally, research has identified SWI/SNF subunit mutations in several types of neurodevelopmental diseases.\"History has shown that genes that mutate in the earliest onset cancers, in babies and toddlers, are often a bit of a 'canary in a coal mine' for broader principles in cancer.\" Roberts said. \"Indeed, while it was studies of rhabdoid tumors in young children that first linked SWI/SNF complexes to cancer, we now know that genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF complexes are mutated in 20% of all cancers. Studying rhabdoid tumors, thus, not only provides insight into these often fatal cancers of young children, it is quite informative about many types of cancer.\"\"Unlike adult cancers, where many genes are mutated, and it is harder to figure out what any single abnormality does, here we have a cancer driven by just this one mutation,\" Roberts added. \"It's a beautiful model to understand how these processes work and then begin to leverage that understanding in adult cancers too.\" More information:Zhexin Zhu et al, Mitotic bookmarking by SWI/SNF subunits, Nature (2023).

The Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute (BDI) team, led by Dr. Rhys Dunstan and Professor Trevor Lithgow of the Bacterial Cell Biology Laboratory, has had some success in tracking down the elusive killers.Published in Cell Reports, their research sheds new light on how phages can select a \"superbug\" bacterium that they will kill while ignoring other bacteria that are good for our health.The findings could lead to an improvement in how individual phages are chosen to treat bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global issue, with an estimated five million deaths globally in 2019, a number which continues to climb.Monash University's Center to Impact AMR runs several superbug surveillance programs that are bioprospecting for phages that kill drug-resistant superbugs. They aim to pinpoint phages that can kill specific superbugs and use them to develop treatments.Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, with an estimated number that is greater than every other organism, including bacteria, combined. Selecting the right one to treat a given infection is not easy.In the latest study, Dr. Dunstan surveyed waste-water at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, U.K., for phages that can kill a deadly variant of the bacterial superbug Klebsiella pneumoniae.Klebsiella pneumoniae normally lives in human intestines, where it doesn't cause disease. But if it travels to other parts of the body, it can cause pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections.After analyzing the bacterial features essential for the two phages to infect Klebsiella pneumoniae, Dr. Dunstan's team revealed that the infection process had two essential steps involving two distinct components of the bacterial cell surface.\"Now, this information can be used predictively to know which infections will respond to treatment with these two phages,\" Dr. Dunstan said.\"One of our aims is to create a biobank of different phages that can kill Klebsiella superbugs. Understanding how these phages kill Klebsiella will allow us to better optimize their use as potential treatments.\" More information:Rhys A.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the mineral rich region in the Pacific Ocean?",
    "text": "There is a massive, mineral-rich region in the Pacific Ocean\u2014about twice the size of India\u2014called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), which has already been divided up and assigned to companies for future deep-sea mining. To better understand what may be at risk once companies start mining, a team of biologists has built the first \"CCZ checklist\" by compiling all the species records from previous research expeditions to the region.          Their estimates of the species diversity of the CCZ, published in the journal Current Biology on May 25, included a total of 5,578 different species found in the region, an estimated 88% to 92% of which are entirely new to science.\"We share this planet with all this amazing biodiversity, and we have a responsibility to understand it and protect it,\" said Muriel Rabone, a deep-sea ecologist at the Natural History Museum London, UK.Spanning 6 million square kilometers from Hawaii to Mexico, the CCZ is one of the most pristine wilderness regions in the global ocean. To study it, researchers brave the Pacific Ocean on research cruises that employ sampling techniques ranging from the technical, like remote-controlled vehicles that traverse the ocean floor, to the simple, like a sturdy box that lands on the bottom (referred to as \"box core sampling\").\"It's a big boat, but it feels tiny in the middle of the ocean. You could see storms rolling in; it's very dramatic,\" said Rabone. \"And it was amazing\u2014in every single box core sample, we would see new species.\"By parsing through over 100,000 records of creatures found in the CCZ taken during these deep-sea expeditions, Rabone and her co-authors found that only six of the new species found in the CCZ\u2014which include a sea cucumber, a nematode, and a carnivorous sponge\u2014have been seen in other regions. They also found that the most common types of animals in the CCZ are arthropods (invertebrates with segmented joints), worms, echinoderms (spiny invertebrates like sea urchins), and sponges.\"There's some just remarkable species down there. Some of the sponges look like classic bath sponges, and some look like vases. They're just beautiful,\" said Rabone of the CCZ samples. \"One of my favorites is the glass sponges. They have these little spines, and under the microscope, they look like tiny chandeliers or little sculptures.\"Going forward, the team emphasizes the importance of increasing cohesive, collaborative, and multidisciplinary research efforts in the CCZ to gain a deeper grasp of the region's biodiversity. They underline the importance of learning more about the newly discovered species and how they are connected to the environment around them. Additionally, they urge researchers to delve into the biogeography of the region to better understand, for example, why certain species cluster in particular geological regions.\"There are so many wonderful species in the CCZ, and with the possibility of mining looming, it's doubly important that we know more about these really understudied habitats,\" said Rabone.

    "text": "Since the emergence of SARS in 2002, coronaviruses have been recognized as potential pandemic threats. This emergence highlights a need for evidence-based strategies to monitor bat coronaviruses. Daniel Becker, Ph.D., a researcher at the University of Oklahoma, is collaborating with other scientists nationwide to determine directions for future research.          Becker, an OU assistant professor of biology, was the senior author of a paper published in Nature Microbiology. The study's lead author was Lily Cohen, a medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and involved collaboration with researchers from Georgetown University and Colorado State University.Becker and colleagues' study is part of the broader efforts of an international research team called the Verena Institute, which works to predict which viruses could infect humans, which animals host them and where they could emerge. Becker was a founding member of the institute in 2020.\"Part of the motivation for this is now that everyone has a lot of interest in bat coronaviruses, how can we do the work better and have a better idea of what is going on with these viruses in nature?\" Becker said. \"This work is important for global health and conservation efforts. The result was a very heavy data-driven recommendation on where to go forward on bat coronaviruses in the wild.\"For this study, researchers focused on highlighting where in the world there hasn't been enough sampling, which groups of bats haven't been sampled enough, and using all available data to improve surveying bats in terms of prioritizing what to do next. During the study, researchers compiled records of coronavirus infection prevalence in wild bats from 110 studies, spanning over 80,000 tested samples, and looked at biases in the way research on bat coronaviruses has been conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Their research found substantial differences in coronavirus prevalence across studies, reflecting variation in virus dynamics over space and time as well as methodological differences. Sample type and sampling design were the best predictors of coronavirus prevalence.Their study shows that bat sampling prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was concentrated in China, with research gaps in South Asia, the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in subfamilies of leaf-nosed bats. Becker and colleagues propose that future surveillance strategies should address these gaps to improve global health security and enable the origins of zoonotic coronaviruses to be identified.

    "question_squad": " What is the largest group of beetles?",
    "text": "Butterflies, bees, and even bats are celebrated as pollinators: creatures that travel from flower to flower to feed, and in the process, help fertilize the plants by spreading pollen. But some of nature's most diverse pollinators often go unnoticed, even by scientists: long-snouted beetles called weevils. A new study in the journal Peer Community in Ecology provides a deep dive into the more than 600 species of weevils, including ones whose entire life cycles are interwoven with a specific plant that they help pollinate.          \"Even people who work on pollination don't usually consider weevils as one of the main pollinators, and people who work on weevils don't usually consider pollination as something relevant to the group,\" says Bruno de Medeiros, an assistant curator of insects at Chicago's Field Museum and the senior author of the study. \"There are lots of important things that people are missing because of preconceptions.\"There are about 400,000 species of beetles that scientists have identified, making them the largest group of animals in the world. And the largest group of beetles are the weevils. \"There are 60,000 species of weevils that we know about, which is about the same as the number of all vertebrate animals put together,\" says de Medeiros. The new study is a review of hundreds of previously published descriptions of interactions between weevils and plants, to better understand their role as pollinators.Weevils are sometimes considered pests; they can sometimes be found in pantries eating pasta and grains, and around the turn of the 20th century, boll weevils disrupted the American South's cotton economy by feeding on cotton buds. However, many species are beneficial to plants, especially as pollinators.                Weevil Anchylorhynchus bicarinatus, the main pollinator of the palm Oenocarpus mapora, found in Amazonia and Central America. Here we see an adult weevil covered in pollen among male flowers. Credit: Bruno de Medeiros             \"In this study, we focused on brood-site pollinators\u2014insects that use the same plants they pollinate as breeding sites for their larvae,\" says de Medeiros. \"It is a special kind of pollination interaction because it is usually associated with high specialization: because the insects spend their whole life cycle in the plant, they often only pollinate that plant. And because the plants have very reliable pollinators, they mostly use those pollinators.\"Brood-site pollination is a little like a more extreme version of the relationship between Monarch butterflies and milkweed, which is the only plant that Monarch caterpillars eat and the site where the butterflies lay their eggs. But brood-site pollinators, unlike Monarchs, take the relationship a step further: adult Monarchs feed on the nectar of many different flowers, but brood-site pollinators, including many species of weevils, rely only on their one plant partner as a source of food and a site for egg-laying.      \"This kind of pollination interaction is generally thought to be rare or unusual,\" says de Medeiros. \"In this study, we show that there are hundreds of weevil species and plants for which this has been documented already, and many, many more yet to be discovered.\"These closely-linked relationships mean that the plants and weevils need each other to flourish. \"Oil palm, which is used to make peanut butter and Nutella, was not a viable industry until someone figured out that the weevils found with them were their pollinators,\" says de Medeiros. \"And because people had an incorrect preconception that weevils were not pollinators, it took much, much longer than it could have taken.\"                    Bruno de Medeiros climbing the palm tree Oenocarpus mapora in Panama to study their pollinators.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the soil that nurtures everything from watermelons to brussel sprouts?",
    "text": "The Midwestern United States has lost 57.6 billion tons of topsoil due to farming practices over the past 160 years, and the rate of erosion, even following the U.S. Department of Agriculture's guidelines, is still 25 times higher than the rate at which topsoil forms.          Yet, we need not despair: researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst recently reported in the journal Earth's Future that no-till farming, which is currently practiced on 40% of cropland acres in the Midwest, can extend our current level of soil fertility for the next several centuries. This has implications for everything from food security to climate-change mitigation.The vast majority of the food we all eat is grown in topsoil, that carbon-rich, black earth that nurtures everything from watermelons to brussels sprouts. What most of us call topsoil, scientists call A-horizon soil, and these A-horizon soils, whose fertility has developed over eons, are susceptible to erosion.\"When most people think of erosion, they think wind or water,\" says Jeffrey Kwang, currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota who completed this research as part of his postdoctoral studies in Isaac Larsen's Geomorphology Research Group at UMass Amherst and is lead author of the paper. \"It turns out that the far greater driver of soil erosion in the midwestern U.S. has been conventional agriculture.\"But what that current rate of erosion is has been very difficult to pin down precisely, though, as the Geomorphology Research Group has shown over the past few years, soil erosion in the U.S.'s breadbasket is far greater, and occurring at a far faster rate, than had previously been suspected.Erosion on the Willis farm since European settlement. Dark brown represents rich topsoil. Credit: Jeffrey KwangA brief history of soil loss in the MidwestSince 2021, members of Larsen's research group, including Kwang, Evan Thaler, Caroline Quarrier and others, have been breaking new ground in the world of soil science.The group's initial study showed that more than one-third of the Corn Belt in the Midwest\u2014nearly 30 million acres\u2014has completely lost its carbon-rich topsoil, that rich A-horizon layer. Furthermore, the team showed that the erosion was likely due to contemporary tillage practices, in which plows are dragged through fields, moving topsoil from higher to lower elevations. Unfortunately, the USDA's own assessments don't include erosion due to tillage, and so the agency has missed a major driver of erosion.A year later, the team discovered that the Midwest has lost 57.6 billion metric tons of soil since Euro-American cultivation of the region began, approximately 160 years ago. This historical rate of loss, which is mostly due to tillage, is nearly double the rate which the USDA considers sustainable.Finally, the team recently showed that Midwestern soil is eroding between 10 and 1,000 times faster than it did in the pre-agricultural era, and that the USDA's current upper-limit of sustainable erosion\u20141 mm per year\u2014is an average of 25 times more than what is actually sustainable.

Their first breakthrough was to finally determine the current rate of tillage-driven soil erosion. It turns out that the Midwest loses 1.1 kilograms of soil and 12 grams of soil organic carbon (SOC) per square meter every year, which far outpaces the rate at which new topsoil is created.But no one knows what the future will look like. \"Since we don't know how farming practices and policy will change,\" Larsen says, \"we've used the current erosion rate to model a few different future scenarios.\"\"We looked at the current business-as-usual method, under which approximately 40% of the midwestern U.S.\"s acres are no-till farmed, all the way up to 100% adoption of no-till methods. We then modeled the erosional rates under each scenario for the next century,\" says Kwang.Their initial finding was that, if the U.S.'s current agricultural practices remain largely unchanged, approximately 8.8 billion metric tons of soil and 170 million metric tons of soil organic carbon will be lost over the next century alone.When the team modeled the impact of a 100% no till scenario, the picture turned rosier. Much rosier.\"Approximately 95% of the erosion we see under the business-as-usual scenario over the next century would be prevented,\" Kwang says.Put another way, the soil savings are so significant that if the U.S. adopts no-till practices now, it would take 10,000 years to see the same level of soil and SOC loss that would occur in only a century if our agricultural practices do not change.Furthermore, the rate of loss decreases over time: the more soil and SOC there is, the faster we lose it, and the rates of loss taper off as there's less to lose. \"This means there's real incentive to act now,\" says Kwang, \"when we'll see the most long-term benefit.\"Soil and climateIt's no surprise that topsoil is crucial for agriculture; but most forecasts for greenhouse gas emission and plans for climate mitigation also need to account for topsoil loss, because soil is the largest pool of terrestrial carbon. Scientists hypothesize that accelerated soil erosion alters this carbon pool enough to influence the global carbon cycle.However, Kwang says, \"most models that look at soil and its effect on climate don't account for erosion rates slowing down over time. We need to get this right if we're to prepare effectively for the future\u2014and know we have a rate that can help inform predictions of what the future climate might be.\" More information:The Future of Soils in the Midwestern United States, Earth's Future (2023).

    "question_squad": " What percentage of Yellowstone's newborn bison don't survive?",
    "text": "A man who picked up a bison calf in Yellowstone National Park caused it to be shunned by its herd, prompting park officials to kill the animal rather than allow it to be a hazard to visitors.          Park officials quickly defended the decision to kill the newborn bison.\"We made the choice we did not because we are lazy, uncaring or inexpert in our understanding of bison biology. We made the choice we did because national parks preserve natural processes,\" the park said in a statement posted Tuesday on Twitter.Park officials' options for dealing with the animal were limited, according to the statement, which said bison must be quarantined before being sent to conservation herds outside the park. A bison calf abandoned and unable to care for itself is not a good candidate for quarantine, the statement said.The calf became separated from its mother when the herd crossed the Lamar River in northeastern Yellowstone on Saturday. The unidentified man pushed the struggling calf up from the river and onto a roadway, park officials said in a news release.Human interference with young wildlife can cause animals to shun their offspring. Park rangers tried repeatedly to reunite the calf with the herd but were unsuccessful.At one point, visitors saw the calf walking up to and following cars and people. This created a hazard, so park staff killed the animal, according to the news release.It's the latest example of Yellowstone visitors getting in trouble or hurt after approaching bison. Park officials euthanized a newborn bison after a similar incident in 2016, when a Canadian man and his son put the calf in their SUV, thinking they could rescue it.The man pleaded guilty. He was fined $235 and ordered to pay $500 to the Yellowstone Park Foundation Wildlife Protection Fund.Bison have gored several people in Yellowstone in recent years, often after they got too close to the animals.Many of Yellowstone's larger animals\u2014including bison, which can run up to 35 mph (55 kilometers per hour) and weigh up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms)\u2014are deceptively dangerous, even when they are just grazing or resting.Park rules require visitors to keep at least 25 yards (23 meters) away from wildlife including bison, elk and deer, and at least 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears and wolves.Park officials are investigating the bison calf incident. The suspect was a white male in his 40s or 50s who was wearing a blue shirt and black pants, the statement said.The calf's body was left on the landscape, similar to the 25% or so of Yellowstone's newborn bison that don't survive, park officials said in the Twitter statement.\"Those deaths will benefit other animals by feeding by feeding everything from bears and wolves to birds and insects. Allowing this cycle of life to play out aligns most closely with the stewardship responsibility entrusted to us by the American people,\" the statement said.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

The 10-day competition runs Aug. 4\u201313 and is open to both professional and novice snake hunters. A grand prize of $10,000 goes to the participant who removes the most pythons, plus smaller prizes for additional categories.\"There is nowhere in the world like America's Everglades, and we need to continue to protect and restore this national treasure,\" South Florida Water Management District Governing Board Member \"Alligator Ron\" Bergeron said in a statement. \"Removing invasive pythons from across the Greater Everglades Ecosystem is absolutely critical, and we must do everything we can to combat this invasive species.\"Participants in last year's competition removed 231 invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, an increase from the 2021 number and more than double those removed in 2020. Nearly 1,000 people from 32 states, Canada and Latvia registered.Besides year-round python removal opportunities on 25 state-managed lands, pythons can be humanely killed on private lands at any time with landowner permission. No permit or hunting license is required, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission encourages people to remove and humanely kill pythons from private lands whenever possible.Burmese pythons are not native to Florida, and they negatively impact native wildlife, officials said. This invasive species is found primarily in and around the Everglades ecosystem in South Florida, where they prey on birds, mammals, and other reptiles. A female Burmese python may lay 50 to 100 eggs at a time. Since 2000, more than 18,000 Burmese pythons have been reported to the FWC as removed from the environment.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Animals using the most of efficient methods of searching for resources may well pay with their lives, scientists at the University of Bristol have discovered.          The findings, published today in Behavioral Ecology, reveal why animals may not always use a searching strategy that maximizes results.How animals move through their habitat, particularly in search for food, is a major question in biology, and has application in how animals will respond to environmental change.Numerous studies have demonstrated that a special kind of movement, known as L\u00e9vy motion, increases the ability to find resources because it includes long-distance moves between areas being searched, as well as periods of concentrated searching in one area. It has also been shown that a range of animals use this kind of movement.This study is the first to demonstrate a potential cost of L\u00e9vy motion in an experiment, showing prey using L\u00e9vy motion are targeted twice as often as prey using Brownian motion\u2014the movement observed in molecules in a gas, and thus a baseline expectation.Professor Christos Ioannou from Bristol's School of Biological Sciences explained, \"We show that this is because the predators prefer to target prey that are moving with straighter paths of motion, possibly because this makes the future position of the prey more predictable.\"                Graph. Credit: Christos Ioannou             Professor Ioannou and his team used a virtual prey approach. They developed a computer simulation of the prey which are identical in size, color, speed, etc., but differ in how they turn.The video was then played to stickleback fish in a tank by projecting the video onto a translucent screen. This allowed the fish to see the prey, and for researchers to capture and record their choices.\"By using an experimental design that presents virtual prey on a screen to real predators, we can control everything about the prey and isolate the variable we're interested in\u2014here, movement\u2014while also using real animals,\" continued Professor Ioannou.This study demonstrates that prey animals might not always use a searching strategy that maximizes finding a resource because there might be costs that were, previous to the study, unknown. This might explain why some studies have found animals use different kinds of searches other than L\u00e9vy motion.He added, \"Our study shows, for the first time, that animals using a common and very effective way of searching for resources may actually pay a cost of being more susceptible to predators.\"\"Going forward, we want to look at whether the prey of sticklebacks show Levy or Brownian motion.\"\"More broadly, our study predicts that prey animals should be less likely to demonstrate L\u00e9vy motion than apex predators.\" More information:Christos C Ioannou et al, Virtual prey with L\u00e9vy motion are preferentially attacked by predatory fish, Behavioral Ecology (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the gondwanatherian that lived in Madagascar?",
    "text": "Approximately 200 million years ago, Antarctica was attached to South America, Africa, India, and Australia in a single \"supercontinent\" called Gondwana. Paleontologists have long wondered about the unique mammals that lived only on this ancient supercontinent, including a particularly elusive group called Gondwanatheria, for which few fossils have been identified.          Now, New York Institute of Technology Associate Professor of Anatomy Simone Hoffmann, Ph.D., is part of a team that is helping to \"unearth\" significant clues about these mysterious animals. In a May 15 study published in the journal Cretaceous Research, Hoffmann and Senior Curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science David Krause, Ph.D., describe the first postcranial remains (skeletal remains apart from the skull) of a gondwanatherian called Vintana. Their findings provide new insights into early mammalian evolution.Vintana lived about 66 million years ago in what is now Madagascar, roaming the earth at the same time as the dinosaurs. Its name means \"lucky\" in the Madagascar language of Malagasy, referring to the fossil's fortunate discovery. Bearing a resemblance to today's groundhogs, Vintana weighed around 19 pounds and is the largest known mammal from the southern hemisphere's Mesozoic era (252 to 66 million years ago) to date.Previously, Vintana was only represented by a fossilized skull, which Hoffmann, Krause, and colleagues detailed in a 2014 study. Several years later, in 2020, the researchers uncovered the nearly complete skeleton of a strange, possum-sized gondwanatherian, dubbed the \"crazy beast\" (Adalatherium). Until now, Adalatherium's fossilized skeleton represented the only postcranial remains in the gondwanatherian fossil record.Now, Hoffmann and Krause's new study presents additional gondwanatherian postcranial evidence and reveals that a vertebra fossil from the Cretaceous of Madagascar was once a Vintana tailbone.Using a micro-Computed Tomography (\u03bcCT) scanner, the researchers scanned the vertebra and compared the virtual surface files to the tail vertebrae from Adalatherium. They found that the vertebra was very similar to that of Adalatherium, the second largest Mesozoic mammal from Madagascar, but much larger\u2014nearly 40 percent larger, to be exact. This size put it solidly within the range to classify it as Vintana.\"While the remains represent only an isolated vertebra from Vintana's larger skeleton, its discovery provides key information about the gondwanatherian lineage,\" says Hoffmann. \"Gondwanatherians had uniquely short tail vertebrae and this new discovery tells us that the tail of Vintana was even wider and shorter than the already stubby tail of Adalatherium.\" More information:David W.

Scientists and college students on Wednesday carefully attached metal tracking bands to the fluffy white chicks' legs. At about a month old, they're still not much bigger than a pigeon and can't yet fly away from their manmade nest atop Spartan Stadium. But the boisterous birds already have sharp talons and beaks, so the banding process was handled with care.The chicks weren't too happy about the experience, writhing and squawking. Once a tag was applied to a chick's leg, the bird was placed back in a box. And the squawking ceased.The chicks have become celebrities in East Lansing and around the globe, thanks to a web camera and livestream by the school's Fisheries and Wildlife Club, which installed the nest box on the stadium roof last year. The chicks could be seen resting calmly in their nest later Wednesday, under the watchful eye of a parent.Club members helped band the chicks on the stadium's 8th floor near the press box, overseen by Chad Fedewa, a wildlife biologist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

They were named in a Twitter contest, and a Michigan elementary school decided on the chicks' monikers.\"I've seen what they do when you have to get to their chicks. Fortunately, they didn't get too close,\" said Schneider, who held an umbrella aloft in case mom or dad made a move toward the humans tasked with retrieving their offspring.\"They make a lot of noise, but they're not too intimidating,\" he said, adding that there were \"a couple of stoops in there,\" referring to a falcon's hunting dive.Peregrine falcons are considered the world's fastest birds. They can reach 200 mph (322 kph) during a dive.

    "text": "There's a lot scientists don't know about the pangolin\u2014a peculiar, scaly mammal that looks like a cross between an aardvark and an armadillo. Now, a new paper published in the journal Chromosome Research reveals what UCLA researcher Jen Tinsman calls a \"scientific surprise\" that underscores how unusual the animal is.          The scientists discovered that the female white-bellied pangolin has 114 chromosomes, more than any mammal except the Bolivian bamboo rat, which has 118\u2014and far more than humans, who have 46. Other pangolin species have more typical numbers of chromosomes, ranging from 36 to 42.The scientists also identified another genetic quirk. Male white-bellied pangolins have a different number of chromosomes, 113, than their female counterparts; in most species, males and females have the same number.\"There's nothing else like them on the planet; they're in their own order, their own family,\" said Tinsman, a UCLA research fellow and co-author of the study, adding that pangolins' closest relatives include cats and rhinoceroses.Tinsman collaborated on the study with colleagues from UCLA and several other universities around the world, as well as zoos and research organizations. The research was undertaken to produce information about the pangolin's genome in order to support conservation efforts\u2014all four species of the pangolin are endangered.One reason little is known about pangolins is that they are notoriously difficult to study. They fare poorly in captivity; only a few zoos have managed to house them successfully. In the wild, they are hard to locate, and the technology scientists use to monitor other species often fails when it comes to pangolins\u2014the animals sometimes use trees to rub radio tags from their scales.What researchers do know about the animals is that they dig and use their long tongues to eat ants, termites and other insects. Some species, including the white-bellied variety, live in trees, hanging from trunks and branches. Others live in burrows. When threatened, pangolins curl into a ball. (Lions have been known to bat them around, unsure what else to do with them.)The white-bellied species is relatively small, weighing in at three or four pounds and measuring less than a foot long, while some ground pangolins grow to 80 or 90 pounds, about the size of a large dog.                Tom Smith, co-director of the Congo Basin Institute, with a pile of pangolin scales. \u201cIt\u2019s this delightful creature that we're hunting to extinction.\u201d Credit: Tom Smith             Aside from its scientific value, the research has created a valuable genetic resource to support conservation efforts, especially attempts to control poaching, which is the primary reason the animals are endangered. Pangolins' scales are sold illegally on international markets for use in traditional medicine from Nigeria to China. They're also hunted as a food source\u2014locally as bush meat, for which they sell for the equivalent of about $10 each, or for exotic meals in distant regions, for which they can fetch over $1,000 on international markets.      \"I've seen pangolin scales trafficked alongside guns, fake IDs and drugs,\" Tinsman said. \"The problem extends all the way up to major international crime syndicates.\"Using genomics could help identify which species of pangolin are the sources for products derived from the animals. Furthermore, the information could help conservationists and researchers understand differences within a species whose habitats cover 6 million square kilometers (2.3 million square miles) and 23 countries.\"Understanding chromosomes and the structure of genes is important for conservation,\" said Ryan Harrigan, an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Tropical Research and a co-author of the paper. \"It can determine how we manage populations\u2014if you found big genetic differences between two groups, you might manage them differently.\"\"This paper is a great example of how a study focused on saving a critical endangered species can also advance fundamental science,\" said UCLA evolutionary biologist Tom Smith, a co-author of the study.And vice versa. With conservation methods and technologies developing rapidly, research findings are increasingly likely to yield practical applications in in the months and years following their discovery.In this case, the new findings could be especially valuable as technologies like artificial intelligence and emerging conservation methods like environmental DNA, or eDNA, are developed and refined.The study also supports a broader effort to track and map pangolin poaching by the Congo Basin Institute, a joint initiative of UCLA and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. The institute, of which Smith is a co-director, is based in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, and includes two rainforest field stations.\"It's this delightful creature that we're hunting to extinction, which just makes me really sad,\" said Smith, who said similar genomic research is planned to conserve other species of pangolins.

    "text": "A few years ago, a French daily newspaper published an article titled \"Korea's Utilization of Algae as a food ingredient for the Earth.\" The article highlighted the ecological potential of algae, which Westerners typically find unappealing due to its soft and pulpy consistency. Algae possesses the ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide and generate significantly less carbon emissions.          Consequently, the mere act of consuming algae could play a constructive role in environmental protection. Nonetheless, advancements have been made in the production of cultivated meat using algae, thus presenting a novel approach for Earth preservation. Furthermore, algae can also be utilized in the engineering of artificial organs for those who are suffering from organ failure.The research team led by Professor Hyung Joon Cha from the Department of Chemical Engineering and the School of Convergence Science and Technology, and Ph.D. candidate Sangmin Lee and Dr. Geunho Choi from the Department of Chemical Engineering at POSTECH have developed a bioink characterized by enhanced cell viability and printing resolution.This accomplishment was achieved through the utilization of alginate derived from algae, a natural carbohydrate, and a harmless visible light. The research findings have been published in Carbohydrate Polymers.3D bioprinting is a methodology employed in the fabrication of artificial organs or tissues through the use of bioinks which contain cells. This technique holds significant promise in the realms of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine while also attracting considerable attention within the foodtech sector due to its potential to produce cultivated meat, an emerging concept in future food production. Nevertheless, currently available bioinks exhibit limitations, impeding cell mobility and resulting in low cell viability and printing resolution.To address these challenges, the research team devised a microgel utilizing a photocrosslinkable alginate. Then, they developed a 3D-printed bioink capable of facilitating free cell movement and proliferation by using this photocrosslinkable alginate microgel. This microgel bioink loaded with cells led to a 4-times increase in cell proliferation compared to conventional bioinks.Furthermore, the microgel demonstrated reduced viscosity when subjected to external forces over a specified period, promptly recovering its initial shape even after deformation. These characteristics significantly increased the resolution and lamination capacity of the printing outcomes.Professor Hyung Joon Cha who led the research explained, \"We engineered functional tissue structures by employing a biomaterial-based bioink with exceptional and stable cell-loading capabilities for practical 3D printing. Future research and refinement of this technology are expected to propel its widespread adoption in the engineering of artificial organs and the production of cultivated meat.\" More information:Sangmin Lee et al, Visible light-crosslinkable tyramine-conjugated alginate-based microgel bioink for multiple cell-laden 3D artificial organ, Carbohydrate Polymers (2023).

    "text": "TEs (transposable elements), especially LTRs, are known to play an important role in determining the basic genome structure and influencing the expression of functional genes. Insertion of TE or LTR fragments may also create novel transcription start sites (TSSs) to initiate transcription in the host genome. New intergenic transcripts were thought to be created by terminal repeat retrotransposon insertions using a combination of de novo and homology-based strategy in maize.       Although these studies have predicted the possibility of new transcript production by transposon insertion, they do not reveal the evolutionary, regulatory and functional mechanisms of these new transcripts. Furthermore, there is not even one systematic study on the extensiveness of intergenic transcript production at the genomic level so far.In a study published in the journal Science China Life Sciences, Yuxian Zhu and their colleagues applied extremely deep-sequencing techniques (from 10 G to over 100 G) in each cotton sample to discover more than 10,000 novel genes that were largely not identified in previous genome assembly and annotations. Most of these transcripts were protein-coding in nature and were created by LTR insertions in various ways.                ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K9me2 markers in genic and intergenic regions at different sequencing depths. Credit: Science China Press             The team found that more transcripts appeared mainly in intergenic regions as identified in the previously published genome. In the 100 G data set, a total of 10,284 new intergenic genes were discovered. In total, 10,032 are protein-coding genes and 252 were lncRNA genes. There was no significant increase in genic gene numbers between these two groups. Generally, these new intergenic transcripts were expressed at very low levels, and most of them were single exon transcripts.These new intergenic transcripts appeared only when the sequencing depth reached to 30 G to 100 G due to their low expression level. ChIP-seq analysis with antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K9me2 revealed that most of these new transcripts might not be transcribed by RNA polymerase\u2161. Only 30% of these intergenic transcripts possessed one or two transcription activation markers while greater than 70% of the genic genes contained these markers.MNase-seq analysis revealed that genes without transcription activation markers formed their +1 and -1 nucleosomes significantly more closely (only 117\u00b11.4 bp apart), while twice as big the spaces (about 403.5\u00b146.0 bp apart) were found for genes with the activation markers. Genes without one of these two markers intended to form -1 nucleosomes at the close vicinity of their +1 nucleosomes. This may impede the binding of the RNA polymerase.                Evolutionary analysis for the origin of genic genes and intergenic transcripts in the G. arboreum genome. Credit: Science China Press             Evolutionary analysis showed that genic genes were originated during one of the whole genome duplication events around 130.8 or 16 MYA, while ITG transcripts were evolved around 2.3 MYA, resultant of the last retrotransposon insertion.Characterization of these low-transcribed ITG transcripts will help us understand the biological roles of retrotransposons during speciation and diversifications. This study may help elucidate the mechanisms related to intergenic transcript expression and cotton fiber development.

    "text": "Species known as marine habitat-forming species \u2014gorgonians, corals, algae, seaweeds, marine phanerogams, etc.\u2014 are organisms that help generate and structure the underwater landscapes. These are natural refuges for other species, and provide biomass and complexity to the seabeds.          But these key species in marine ecosystems are currently threatened by climate change and other perturbations derived from human activity. Now, a study published in the journal Global Ecology and Biogeography warns that even in the marine protected areas (MPAs) the genetic diversity of structural species is not protected, although it is essential for the response and adaptation of populations to changes that alter the natural environment.The study was carried out by Laura Figuerola-Ferrando, Cristina Linares, Ignasi Montero-Serra and Marta Pag\u00e8s-Escol\u00e0, from the Faculty of Biology of the University of Barcelona and the Biodiversity Research Institute of the UB (IRBio); Jean-Baptiste Ledoux and Aldo Barreiro, from the Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR) in Portugal, and Joaquim Garrabou, from the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC).Genetic diversity is also a component of biodiversityTraditionally, marine biodiversity management and conservation plans have considered factors such as species richness. Genetic diversity \u2014another major component of biodiversity\u2014 reflects the genetic variation that exists among organisms of the same species and is a determining factor in the adaptive capacity of populations and their survival. Despite its importance, genetic diversity has so far been overlooked in management and conservation plans.\"Genetic diversity plays a key role in enhancing the ability of species, populations and communities to adapt to rapid environmental changes resulting from climate change and thus increase their resilience,\" says researcher Laura Figuerola-Ferrando, first author of the study.\"However, so far, the vast majority of marine protected areas are implemented based on the presence of several species and habitats, without considering their genetic diversity. Another example would be the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which does not consider genetic diversity either.\"\"In recent years, the need to focus conservation efforts on the protection of genetic diversity has been reinforced. Technological progress in the massive development of different techniques to determine genetic diversity (for example, through the use of microsatellites or small DNA fragments), as well as their affordable cost, can help to include genetic diversity in management and conservation plans,\" says the researcher from the Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences of the UB.      From the northwest Atlantic to the Gulf of GuineaThe study applies macrogenetic techniques to identify general genetic patterns of diverse marine species at large spatial scales. The authors have analyzed data from a global database containing genetic diversity information (based on microsatellites) for more than 9,300 populations of 140 species in different marine regions around the globe.The results outline a reference scenario of genetic patterns in marine habitat-forming species (corals, macroalgae, marine phanerogams, etc.) of potential interest for improving marine life management and conservation plans.The northwest Atlantic provinces and the Bay of Bengal are the regions where the highest genetic diversity in marine landscape species has been identified. Quite high values (above the global average) have also been identified in the Mediterranean. In contrast, the marine provinces with the lowest values of genetic diversity are the Gulf of Guinea and the southwest Atlantic.The findings also indicate a positive correlation between genetic diversity and species richness of both animal and plant marine habitat-forming species. However, the paper warns of a worrying result: the Network of Marine Protected Areas (RAMP) in the large oceanic ecoregions does not preserve areas where the genetic diversity of marine habitat-forming species is highest.\"What we have seen is that what is not being protected in MPAs is genetic diversity. In the study, the initial hypothesis was that within these areas there would be greater genetic diversity, but this has not been the case. In fact, we have seen, at a global level, that there are no differences in genetic diversity between inside and outside the MPAs,\" notes Laura Figuerola-Ferrando, who is doing her doctoral thesis under the supervision of Cristina Linares (UB) and Joaquim Garrabou (ICM-CSIC).A new pattern of equatorial biodiversity at the polesThe authors have also identified a specific pattern in the distribution of genetic diversity of the marine habitat-forming species that differs from the traditional models known to date.\"This is a bimodal latitudinal pattern: it is a complex biogeographic model and it implies that if we model how the genetic diversity of these species varies with latitude, we find two peaks in temperate zones and a small dip in genetic diversity at the equator,\" notes the ICREA Academia Professor Cristina Linares (UB-IRBio), one of the coordinators of the study together with Jean-Baptiste Ledoux (CIIMAR).This scientific discovery is relevant because until a few decades ago it was considered that the distribution of biodiversity on the planet followed a unimodal pattern, that is, it had maximum values at the equator and decreased towards the poles. \"This is not always the case, especially in terms of species diversity in marine ecosystems. For example, in the case of benthic species, this pattern is biomodal rather than unimodal in terms of both species richness and genetic diversity,\" explains Cristina Linares.\"In our study, the bimodal latitudinal pattern is influenced by taxonomy: in the used model, we found statistically significant differences between animal species (more genetic diversity) and plant species (less genetic diversity). Furthermore, if we explore the latitudinal pattern separating animal and plant species, we can see that a bimodal pattern continues to be observed in animals, but the same cannot be said for plants,\" adds researcher Jean-Baptiste Ledoux (CIIMAR).Genetic diversity: Improving conservation management plansThe conclusions of the work recall the need to include the genetic diversity of populations in biodiversity management and conservation plans on the planet.\"The importance of having genetic diversity in biodiversity management and conservation plans has just been reinforced with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework within the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD/COP/15/L25, 2022). In this context, we believe that the baseline on genetic diversity patterns in marine habitat-forming species defined as our work can be very relevant,\" notes Jean-Baptiste Ledoux.This study also reveals that the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions are among the most present in the scientific literature used in this work on macrogenetic patterns of deep-sea structural species.\"On the other hand, if we look at the analyzed taxa, we see that the Mediterranean Sea is the marine province where we have studies of more different taxa (octocorals, hexacorals, sponges, marine phanerogams and algae). In the northern Atlantic there is also quite a variety of taxa (mainly algae, marine phanerogams, but also hexacorals, octocorals, bryozoans and sponges). On the other hand, in the southern Atlantic, studies are mainly focused on algae,\" the researchers conclude.

    "question_squad": " What is the process called that coccolithophores use to extract carbon?",
    "text": "Coccolithophores, a globally ubiquitous type of phytoplankton, play an essential role in the cycling of carbon between the ocean and atmosphere. New research from Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences shows that these vital microbes can survive in low-light conditions by taking up dissolved organic forms of carbon, forcing researchers to reconsider the processes that drive carbon cycling in the ocean. The findings were published this week in Science Advances.          The ability to extract carbon from the direct absorption of dissolved organic carbon is known as osmotrophy. Though scientists had previously observed osmotrophy by coccolithophores using lab-grown cultures, this is the first evidence of this phenomenon in nature.The team, led by Senior Research Scientist William Balch, undertook their experiments in populations of coccolithophores across the northwest Atlantic Ocean. They measured the rate at which phytoplankton fed on three different organic compounds, each labeled with chemical markers to track them. The dissolved compounds were used by the coccolithophores as a carbon source for both the organic tissues that comprise their single cells as well as the inorganic mineral plates, called coccoliths, which they secrete around themselves. Uptake of the organic compounds was slow compared to the rate at which phytoplankton can take up carbon through photosynthesis. But it wasn't negligible.\"The coccolithophores aren't winning any 'growth race' by taking-up these dissolved organic materials,\" Balch said. \"They are just eking out an existence, but they can still grow, albeit slowly.\"Plants, like coccolithophores, typically acquire their carbon for growth from inorganic forms of carbon extracted from the atmosphere like carbon dioxide and bicarbonate through photosynthesis. When coccolithophores die, they sink, carrying all that carbon down to the ocean floor where it can be remineralized or buried, effectively sequestering it for millions of years. This process is called the biological carbon pump.As part of a parallel process called the alkalinity pump, coccolithophores also convert bicarbonate molecules in surface water into calcium carbonate\u2014essentially limestone\u2014that forms their protective coccoliths. Again, when they die and sink, all that dense inorganic carbon is ballasted to the seafloor. Some of it then dissolves back into bicarbonate, thus \"pumping\" alkalinity from the surface to depth.      But the new evidence suggests that coccolithophores aren't just using these inorganic forms of carbon near the surface. They're also taking up dissolved organic carbon, the largest pool of organic carbon in the sea, and fixing some of it into their coccoliths, which ultimately sink into the deep ocean. This suggests that the uptake of these free-floating organic compounds is another step in both the biological and alkalinity pumps that drive the transport of carbon from the ocean surface to depths below.\"There's this big dissolved organic carbon source in the ocean that we always assumed wasn't really related to the carbonate cycle in the sea,\" Balch said. \"Now we're saying that some fraction of the carbon that is going to depth is really coming from that enormous pool of dissolved organic carbon.\"This is the third and final paper published as part of a three-year project. The overall effort was inspired by a decades-old dissertation by William Blankley, a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Balch's alma mater. In the 1960s, Blankley was able to grow coccolithophores in the dark for 60 days feeding them glycerol, one of the organic compounds used in the present study. Unfortunately, he died before his research could be published. The fact that Blankley's findings could be reproduced all these years later with new technology, Balch said, is credit to the quality of that early work.The real challenge of the most recent study, though, was to undertake that research outside of a controlled lab environment. The team had to devise a method to measure these organic compounds in seawater\u2014at ambient concentrations orders of magnitude lower than the Blankley experiments\u2014and then track how they were being taken up by wild coccolithophores.\"When you culture phytoplankton in the lab, you can grow as much as you want. But in the ocean, you take what you get,\" Balch said. \"The challenge was finding a signal in all the noise to say, proof positive, that it was coccolithophores taking up these organic molecules into their coccoliths.\"Though the current project is complete, Balch said the next step is to examine whether coccolithophores are able to take up other organic compounds found in seawater at the same rate as the three tested thus far. Though the coccolithophores were using the three dissolved compounds at slow rates in these experiments, there are thousands of other organic molecules in seawater that they could potentially absorb. If they are using more of them, this finding may prove to be an even more significant step in understanding the global carbon cycle.

    "text": "Most people probably associate algal blooms with red tides in Florida that can lead to skin irritation, burning eyes and rashes in exposed individuals.          But, increasingly, Alaska's Bering Strait also is home to toxic algal blooms\u2014blooms that threaten the shellfish industry and cause paralytic shellfish poisoning that imperils the lives of seals, birds, fish, foraging pets and even humans.Northeastern University co-op student Anushka Rajagopalan is part of a team of researchers in Don Anderson's lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts who are studying the conditions behind the creation of Alaska's harmful algae blooms, with an eye to contributing to mitigation efforts.In particular, Rajagopalan is focused on Alexandrium catenella, a single-celled marine plankton that produces the neurotoxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning.\"It's impacted the Alaskan coastal community pretty severely,\" says Rajagopalan, whose six-month co-op ends June 30.\"A lot of restaurants have had to close down and a lot of fish markets haven't been able to collect shellfish from affected areas for several years now,\" she says.\"Indigenous communities are particularly impacted by it because shellfish and fish are main sources of subsistence,\" Rajagopalan says.Poisoning occurs after shellfish ingest the neurotoxin created by algal blooms.\"The shellfish themselves don't get poisoned. But other marine animals, like seals, who eat shellfish have been having higher mortality rates because of this poisoning,\" Rajagopalan says.The poisonings also affect other marine animals, birds, fish, pets foraging on beaches and even humans.The Washington state Department of Health says deaths have occurred 30 minutes after ingesting poisoned shellfish, with fatalities attributed to suffocation as chest muscles become paralyzed. There is no antidote to the poisoning, only life support for severe cases.                Cells of the toxic Alexandrium catenella algae seen under a microscope using fluorescent probes.

The co-op student says she is finalizing analysis of water and sediment samples containing Alexandrium cells collected by a WHOI research vessel from a stretch of sea from western Alaska to the eastern border of Russia.Each tube of water comes with information about the temperature, salinity, nutrient content and other environmental factors in its collection area, Rajagopalan says.She examines the Alexandrium cells under a microscope using fluorescent probes, a protocol known as the FISH method for Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization.\"They collected samples not only at the surface of the water but at various depths throughout the water,\" Rajagopalan says.\"We're wondering whether these Alexandrium blooms differ based on water depth and how that could relate to other environmental factors such as physical oceanographical and biogeochemical factors.\"A 2021 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries says that algal blooms were once rare in Alaska but are increasing, which scientists from NOAA and WHOI say is due in at least part to warming seas.The Anderson lab at WHOI hopes to publish the results of the research she is working on by next year, says Rajagopalan, who plans to finish up her undergraduate degree at Northeastern by 2024.She says she intends to pursue a Ph.D. in fields relating to biodiversity and conservation biology, perhaps coral biology\u2014which she studied in her first co-op last year at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.In the meantime, Rajagopalan is counting on research being done at Anderson's WHOI lab to make a difference when it comes to combating the effects of algal blooms.\"There are whole communities around the world that are relying on this research and information,\" she says.\"Awareness about these projects will hopefully bring more support and funding for long-term monitoring.

    "text": "Non-avian dinosaurs were probably in decline long before an asteroid smashing into the Yucatan Peninsula 66 million years ago sealed their fate, according to a University of Alberta paleontologist who says the ancient tale is chronicled at three stops on an astonishing three-hour drive along the Red Deer River.          This tour of Alberta's prehistoric past takes its lead from a 2021 study by an international research team that included input from Phil Currie. The study suggests the failure of dinosaurs to recover from the cataclysmic asteroid impact was amplified by their inability to adapt to a changing environment.Currie explains the idea behind a gradual extinction first surfaced four decades ago, shortly after it became generally accepted that the impact of a large asteroid at Chicxulub, Mexico, was responsible for a rapid and catastrophic annihilation of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period.\"Since then, some experts argue that there was no catastrophe\u2014that that's a red herring and dinosaurs died out slowly for other reasons, although they may have been finished off by the asteroid strike. Others feel it happened very rapidly,\" he says.\"Either way, Alberta is a pretty key place in settling this.\"Tracing a trail of gradual extinctionCurrie and a team led by Fabien Condamine from the Institute of Evolutionary Science of Montpellier, France, analyzed 1,600 dinosaur fossils to assess speciation\u2014when a group within a species develops its own unique characteristics\u2014and extinction rates for six major dinosaur families found in Alberta: Ankylosauridae, Ceratopsidae, Hadrosauridae, Dromaeosauridae, Troodontidae and Tyrannosauridae.\"We found they were all definitely in decline, not over a short period of time, the last million years before the end, but over a period of 10 million years before the end starting 76 million years ago,\" he says.This decline can be traced along the Red Deer River, starting at the heartland of Alberta's Badlands, Dinosaur Provincial Park, southeast of Calgary. There, paleontologists have unearthed more than 50 species of dinosaurs that date back 76 million years.\"It's hard to imagine an ecosystem today that could support 50 species of large animals, let alone 150 species of other vertebrates including mammals, birds, pterosaurs, lizards, snakes, turtles and fish,\" said Currie. \"Dinosaur Park is undeniably one of the richest fossil sites for dinosaurs in the world, if not the richest.\"Following along Veterans Memorial Highway (H36), Cretaceous enthusiasts head upstream to the Drumheller region, which is stratigraphically about four million years younger than Dinosaur Provincial Park. There, paleontologists have uncovered only 30 species of dinosaurs, despite the area once hosting a large cross-section of environments.\"You're looking at fairly big changes over a pretty short distance (145 kilometers) and over a relatively short period of time,\" said Currie.A quick hour-long drive north along Highway 56 splitting the difference between the Red Deer River and the Rumsey Natural Area\u2014home to Canada's largest remaining undisturbed tract of aspen parkland and some of the most productive waterfowl habitats on the continent\u2014dinosaur hunters will end the tour at Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park. Its fossil record is representative of a time at the end of the Cretaceous that lasted from 145 million to 66 million years ago, just before the asteroid hit\u2014about 10 million years younger than Dinosaur Provincial Park. By the time the Cretaceous came to a close 66 million years ago, only a dozen dinosaur species remained in Alberta.\"Here in Alberta, it's quite clear that the number of species is dropping quite radically over the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous,\" says Currie.      Declining diversityTheories abound about why dinosaurs were in decline, but Currie believes the late Cretaceous came with a climatic shift that was less favorable for big animals.\"Big animals have their greatest diversity when you have very stable environments with good climates and lots of varied food resources for them,\" he said. \"But as soon as the climate deteriorates, the diversity of plants goes down, the diversity of the animals goes down, which especially affects the bigger animals.\"As Currie explains, North America during the Cretaceous was characterized by inland seas that covered much of the continent and stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. However, mountain ranges growing to the west ultimately pushed the inland seas southward, and the resulting land elevation eventually blocked the warm southern currents from emptying into the Arctic.\"This resulted in a more continental climate, which usually means the reduction in diversity of animals,\" he says.\"I believe the asteroid was still the coup de gr\u00e2ce, but I don't think it would have had the same effect if it had hit 10 million years earlier, when dinosaurs were much more diverse.\" Provided byUniversity of AlbertaCitation:What if dinosaurs were already in decline when the asteroid struck?

    "text": "Like thread tightly wrapped around a spool, DNA is wrapped around histones and packaged into structures called nucleosomes. Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital are exploring how a type of transcription factor called a pioneer transcription factor accesses DNA even when it is tightly wound. Their work revealed how the epigenetic landscape influences transcription factor binding.          Problems with transcription have been implicated in numerous cancers, so this more detailed understanding of the process may aid in developing future therapeutics. The study was published in Nature.The nucleosome packaging of DNA can physically block transcription factors that regulate gene expression from accessing their binding sites. Restricting access to DNA is an integral part of how transcription is regulated. However, pioneer transcription factors can bind to their target piece of DNA even within compacted chromatin and are also known to promote the binding of other transcription factors.Among pioneer transcription factors are the so-called Yamanaka factors which include Oct4 and are used to induce pluripotency (the ability to give rise to different cell types). How pioneer transcription factors access tightly wound DNA was unclear. To better understand the process, scientists at St. Jude used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and biochemistry to investigate how Oct4 interacts with nucleosomes.\"Building on prior work to understand the dynamic behavior of nucleosomes, we wanted to understand how other factors might utilize those dynamic changes to access chromatin,\" said corresponding author Mario Halic, Ph.D., St. Jude Department of Structural Biology. \"Oct4 did not bind where we anticipated it might\u2014rather than binding inside the nucleosome, we found that it bound a little bit outside.\"\"One of the main findings is that epigenetic modifications can affect transcription factor binding and cooperativity,\" Halic added. \"The existing epigenetic state of chromatin can determine how transcription factors will cooperatively bind to chromatin.\"The epigenetic impactResults show that the first Oct4 molecule binding \"fixes\" the nucleosome in a position that increases the exposure of other binding sites, thus promoting the binding of additional transcription factors and explaining transcription factor cooperativity. They also found that Oct4 contacts histones, and these interactions promote chromatin opening and influence cooperativity.Their work also showed that modifications at histone H3K27 affect the positioning of DNA by Oct4. These findings explain how the epigenetic landscape can regulate Oct4 activity to ensure proper cell programming.Notably, the researchers used endogenous human DNA sequences instead of artificial sequences to assemble their nucleosomes. This allowed them to study the dynamic nature of the nucleosome, despite it being more challenging to work with.\"In this work, we used real genomic DNA sequences to study transcription factors in the context of where they function,\" said first author Kalyan Sinha, Ph.D., St. Jude Department of Structural Biology.\"This strategy allowed us to discover that the first binding event of Oct4 positions the nucleosomal DNA in a manner that allows cooperative binding of additional Oct4 molecules to internal sites. In addition, we observed exciting interactions with histone tails and have seen that histone modifications can alter those interactions. Together, these findings provide new insights into the pioneering activity of Oct4.\"\"Histone modifications affect how DNA is positioned and how transcription factors can bind cooperatively,\" Sinha added, \"which means in cells, if you have the same DNA sequence, different epigenetic modifications can result in different, combinatorial effects on transcription factor binding.\" More information:Mario Halic, Histone modifications regulate pioneer transcription factor cooperativity, Nature (2023).

    "text": "Wild chimpanzees are being exposed to a cocktail of harmful chemicals.          Pesticides and flame retardants are among the pollutants found in their feces, suggesting that the chemicals may be having an impact on the primates' health and development.Primate poo is revealing how pollutants are affecting threatened species in the wild.A new study found that the feces of four primate species living in Uganda's Kibale National Park, including chimpanzees and red colobus monkeys, contained significant levels of pesticides and flame retardants.Female primates and their young were found to be the most affected, with the researchers linking the pollutants with higher levels of stress and reproductive hormones in these animals. This suggests the compounds might be disrupting how their body functions and potentially affecting their growth and development.Tessa Steiniche, a Ph.D. student and lead author of the study, says, \"Endocrine disruption in juveniles is especially concerning because exposure to these chemicals during critical periods of development can have a really lasting impact.\"The researchers warn that the chemicals featured in this study may be just the tip of the iceberg, with more compounds likely to be impacting these primates.\"Unfortunately for these primates the benefits of inhabiting a 'protected' area do not really include protection from chemical pollution,\" Tessa adds. \"Human activity around the park, and even tourism and research within it, can all introduce potentially harmful chemicals.\"\"It's likely our study only scratches the surface on the suite of chemicals these primates are encountering.\"The findings of the paper were published in the journal Biology Letters.The impacts of chemical pollution on wildlifeOver the past century, there has been an unprecedented rise in pollution across the planet. From microplastics in the Arctic and inside our bodies, to sewage in our rivers and seas, the issue affects our lives on a scale we're yet to fully comprehend.Of the many different types of pollution, chemical pollutants are perhaps the best understood. A variety of studies over the years have revealed the effects they can have on life at a variety of scales.The growth of algae, for instance, can be harmed by antibiotics in water by limiting their ability to carry out photosynthesis.At the other end of the scale, killer whales are known to be affected by chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of chemicals formerly used as coolants. These can interfere with the animal's immune system and reproduction as they build up in the orca's blubber.But the methods behind such earlier research have been problematic. Historically, these studies have used laboratory experiments which can overlook how mixtures of the chemicals affect health or relied on samples from dead animals which can have much higher levels of pollutants than average.More recently, scientists have been trying to account for these issues by turning to biomonitoring techniques allowing them to study wild animals in their own habitat.In the current study this meant taking poo samples from four species of primate living in Kibale National Park, including chimpanzees, olive baboons, red-tailed monkeys and the Ugandan red colobus. This allowed the researchers to measure levels of not only the pollutants themselves, but also the hormones they might affect.\"Toxicology has been undergoing a renaissance over the past few decades towards improving animal ethics, and fecal biomonitoring can offer a really valuable approach,\" Tessa says. \"While fecal samples aren't exactly the cleanest matrix to work with, the opportunity to study the impacts of pollution in wild animals without any sort of harm or manipulation is pretty neat.\"      How are primates affected by chemical pollutants?Analyzing the samples, the researchers found 97 different pollutants in the primate feces. These were grouped into three main groups: organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate esters (OPEs) used in plastic production.It's likely that the animals became exposed to these compounds by raiding farms surrounding the national park for food, as well as encountering electrical and plastic waste within the forest.Some chemicals were particularly common in the primate poo, with one BFR found in over 70% of samples across all four species. As experiments on mice have shown that mammals exposed to BFRs at a young age aren't very good at excreting the chemical, it may mean that BFRs are accumulating in these primates and putting them at greater risk of more damaging health effects.Younger animals are also thought to be at more risk, as higher levels of BFRs in juvenile primates were associated with lower levels of the sex hormone estradiol and higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.While there are relatively few studies on the effects of these chemicals on mammals, they have been linked with problems such as liver damage, reduced hormone production, brain development and an impaired immune system.For Endangered species like the chimpanzee, the findings of this study adds another burden for populations which are already under pressure. The researchers hope that future projects will be able to build on this work to get a better picture of how contaminated other wild animals are, and find out how they are being affected.\"My co-authors and I are interested in taking a closer look into the sources of chemical exposure at Kibale, as well as exploring why different species are more or less susceptible to certain pollutants,\" Tessa says.\"It will also be essential to include more social dimensions in our research, so that the surrounding communities have the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions regarding chemical use and disposal.\" More information:Tessa Steiniche et al, Associations between faecal chemical pollutants and hormones in primates inhabiting Kibale National Park, Uganda, Biology Letters (2023).

    "text": "Varroa mites\u2014notorious honey bee parasites\u2014have recently reached Australian shores, detected at the Port of Newcastle in New South Wales last year. If they establish here, there would be significant implications for agricultural food security, as honey bees are heavily relied on for the pollination of many crops.          However, while Australia is the last continent to be invaded by the mite, it has an opportunity to be the first to eradicate it.Varroa destructor is a small mite that attaches to bees and eats their \"fat body.\" The fat bodies of honey bees are the insect equivalent of a liver. Varroa weakens bees, reduces their lifespan and increases the spread of deadly viruses.Scientists need to be ready: this might be Australia's best chance to collect important data on the spread and evolution of this parasite. Our new paper published today in Biology Letters outlines what questions scientists need to ask and what data they need to collect if Varroa spreads in Australia.Such data could help us understand how parasites evolve, why Varroa are so damaging for honey bees, and how Varroa mites impact other insects and the environment.Will Varroa establish in Australia? Australia is in close proximity to countries that have the mite, including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Indonesia.This probably explains why invasive honey bee swarms are frequently intercepted at our ports, many of these carrying Varroa. Australia currently bans importation of honey bee colonies due to the biosecurity risk, so these interceptions are typically due to stowaway swarms taking up residence in shipping containers.                A Varroa mite fallen from a hive in France. Credit: Th\u00e9otime Colin, Author provided             Previous invasions of Varroa have been successfully eradicated before establishing, but this time Varroa circumvented the biosecurity surveillance near Newcastle and spread locally.The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries has been contact-tracing and culling hives in contaminated areas, and the spread has been slow so far. Australia has large populations of feral honey bees, which could potentially act as a reservoir for Varroa and are much harder to trace and control, so the department is tackling this with a wild honey bee baiting program.      What threats does Varroa pose? Varroa mites are a threat to food security. Although Australia has an abundance of food and exports it to other nations, the price of food is likely to increase if Varroa escapes confinement.Currently, pollination of crops in eradication zones such as berries in Coffs Harbor is at risk due to the removal of all honey bees in the region, which may lead to short-term increases in food costs.However, establishment and spread of Varroa will lead to lower pollination and lower crop production across the country, which will raise the price of most fruit and vegetables that depend on bee pollination.This could worsen the food affordability crises caused by the current inflation, affecting the ability of low income households to buy nutritious and fresh produce. Almond pollination has already noted a deficit of 80,000 hives in the last season.                Australia currently relies on pollination by commercial honey bees (yellow), supplemented by feral honey bees (brown), though we have many native bee species like stingless bees and blue banded bees that are also being used in crop pollination. Credit: Boris Yagound, adapted from Chapman et al. 2023, CC BY Many of the honey bee colonies that pollinate our crops are thought to be feral, living in tree hollows or nest-boxes designed for native animals. These feral bees are not managed by beekeepers and so won't be saved by the use of Varroa treatments, meaning they will most likely disappear.Varroa may be a threat to wild pollinators including native bees. Varroa often spreads viruses, which can jump between species and may threaten our wild native pollinators. Of particular concern are viruses that deform insect wings and cause paralysis. Fortunately, these viruses have not been detected in the current Varroa incursion.How can we secure Australia's agricultural industry? Australia's agricultural industry relies mostly on pollination by European honey bees. This choice has been risky.In Europe, pollination services are also provided by diverse species like bumble bees, mining bees and mason bees (e.g. Osmia rufa), many of which are un-managed wild species that nest alone.If Varroa escapes confinement, beekeepers will still be able to maintain colonies of honey bees but at greater costs, due to colony losses and the need for chemicals to treat Varroa mites in the hives. These costs have the potential to sink businesses, and affect the livelihoods of beekeepers.Australia needs to decrease its reliance on the European honey bee in agriculture and improve pollinator diversity via the use of other native pollinator species such as native stingless bees, blue banded bees, or even flies. For example, native Australian stingless bees aid in the pollination of macadamia and capsicum crops and could be used for the pollination of other crops.Native blue banded bees pollinating tomatoes in Australia.Australia's unique situation Australia is different from other Varroa infected regions of the world. Our incursion was smaller, it was identified early and the management zone is small enough to be feasibly eradicated.Even if Varroa spreads in Australian landscapes, hopes are that the pace of the spread may be slower in Australia than it was in other regions due to the smaller incursion, the colossal eradication effort and large tracts of land that are inhospitable to honey bees. Managed honey bee populations are concentrated around coastal regions, or in Australia's major rural food bowl regions where pollinator-dependant crops (such as almonds, blueberries and apples) are located.This gives us a chance to prevent the spread of Varroa across inland Australia, where there are no honey bees.Luckily for us, most of the world has already spent the last few decades trying to minimize Varroa mite management costs. As a nation, we now have the chance to initiate a fresh and coordinated management response. Australia could organize state-wide integrated pest management approaches and treatment regimes to prevent Varroa's resistance to chemical treatments from developing rapidly.In short, there are good reasons to remain positive about the future of Australian beekeeping and horticultural industries, but there is still much work for our research community to do.

    "text": "Heat-stressed fish embryos release chemical signals that change the appearance, behavior, and development of fish embryos that were not heat stressed, according to a study. Stress during development can change how an embryo grows and which genes are activated. Katharina Wollenberg Valero and colleagues explored how stress might be communicated to other animals and what the consequences are. Their work is published in the journal PNAS Nexus.       Using zebrafish (Danio rerio), a classic model organism, the authors heated embryos to a stressful +5\u2103 over normal temperature, a temperature that is expected to occur more frequently during heat waves. The authors found that heat-stressed embryos tended to grow more quickly, show reduced response to new stimuli, and hatch early compared to controls.The authors then looked within the embryos' growth medium for chemical cues that could act as messengers of heat stress and found that \"stress metabolites\" include both sulfur-containing compounds and fats. Next, the authors exposed other zebrafish embryos to these stress metabolites to see whether the embryos react in similar ways to the cues as to heat stress itself.The authors found that the stress metabolites influenced activity of genes associated with immune response, extracellular signaling, as well as with structural components of the cell membrane such as sugars and fats. These non-heat-stressed embryos showed a pattern of quick growth and reduced activity that was similar to that of the heat-stressed embryos, but achieved through a different molecular pathway. According to the authors, such propagation of heat stress across groups of individuals has implications for both ecology and animal welfare in a warming world.

    "question_squad": " What is the origin of paired appendages?",
    "text": "An international collaboration that includes scientists from the University of Colorado School of Medicine has uncovered new clues about the origin of paired appendages\u2014a major evolutionary step that remains unresolved and highly debated.          The researchers describe their study in an article published in the journal Nature.\"This has become a topic that comes with bit of controversy, but it's really a very fundamental question in evolutionary biology: Where do our limbs come from?\" says co-corresponding author Christian Mosimann, Ph.D., associate professor and Johnson Chair in the Department of Pediatrics, Section of Developmental Biology at CU School of Medicine.That question\u2014where do our limbs come from?\u2014has been subject of debate for more than 100 years. In 1878, German scientist Carl Gegenbaur proposed that paired fins derived from a source called the gill arch, which are bony loops present in fish to support their gills. Other scientists favor the lateral fin fold hypothesis, concluding that lateral fins on the top and bottom of the fish are the source of paired fins.\"It is a highly active research topic because it's been an intellectual challenge for such a long time,\" Mosimann says. \"Many big labs have studied the various aspects of how our limbs develop and have evolved.\" Among those labs are Dr. Mosimann's colleagues and co-authors, Tom Carney, Ph.D., and his team at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.Chasing the odd cellsFor Mosimann, the inquiry into where limbs come from is an offshoot of other research conducted by his laboratory on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. In his laboratory, his team uses zebrafish as a model to understand the development from cells to organs. He and his team study how cells decide their fate, looking for explanations for how development can go awry leading to congenital anomalies, in particular cardiovascular and connective tissue diseases.Along the way, Mosimann and his lab team observed how a peculiar cell type with features of connective tissue cells, so-called fibroblasts that share a developmental origin with the cardiovascular system, migrated into specific developing fins of the zebrafish. It turns out that these cells may support a connection between the competing theories of paired appendage evolution.\"We always knew these cells were odd,\" he says. \"There were these fibroblast-looking cells that went into the so-called ventral fin, the fin at the belly of the developing zebrafish. Similar fibroblast cells didn't crawl into any other fin except the pectoral fin, which are the equivalent of our arms. So we kept noticing these peculiar fibroblasts, and we could never make sense of what these were for many years.\"The Mosimann lab has developed several techniques to track cell fates during development in pursuit of their main topic, which is an improved understanding of how the embryonic cell layer, called the lateral plate mesoderm, contributes to diverse organs. The lateral plate mesoderm is the developmental origin of the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, connective tissue, as well as major parts of limbs.The paired fins that form the equivalent of our arms and legs are seeded by cells from the lateral plate mesoderm, while other fins are not. Understanding how these particular fins became more limb-like has been at the core of a long-standing debate.      Developing new theoriesHannah Moran, who is pursuing her Ph.D. in the Cell Biology, Stem Cells and Development program in the Mosimann lab, adapted a method of tracking lateral plate mesoderm cells that contribute to heart development so that researchers could track the peculiar fibroblasts related to limb development.\"My primary research project focuses on the development of the heart rather than limb development,\" Moran says, \"but there was a genetic technique that I had adapted to map early heart cells, and so we were able to implement that into mapping where the mysterious cells of the ventral fin came from. And turns out, they are also from the lateral plate mesoderm.\"This crucial discovery provides a new puzzle piece to the big picture of how we evolved our arms and legs. Increasing evidence supports a hypothesis of paired appendage evolution called the dual origin theory.\"Our data fit nicely into this combined theory, but it can also stand on its own with the lateral fin theory,\" says Robert Lalonde, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the Mosimann lab. \"While paired appendages arise from the lateral plate mesoderm, that does not rule out an ancient connection to unpaired, lateral fins.\"By observing the mechanisms of embryonic development and comparing the anatomy of existing species, research groups like Mosimann's can develop theories on how embryonic structures may have evolved or have been modified over time.\"The embryo has features that are still ancient remnants that they have not lost yet, which provides insight into how animals have evolved,\" Mosimann says. \"We can use the embryo to learn more about features that just persist today, allowing us to kind of travel back in time,\" Mosimann says. \"We see that the body has a fundamental, inherent propensity to form bilateral, two-sided structures. Our study provides a molecular and genetic puzzle piece to resolve how we came to have limbs. It adds to this 100-plus year discussion, but now we have molecular insights.\"International collaborationCollaborations with colleagues in laboratories across the country and around the world are another important part of the study. Those scientists bring additional specializations and contribute data from other models, including paddlefish, African clawed frogs, and a variant of split-tail goldfish called Ranchu, to study embryonic development.\"There are labs on this on this paper that work on musculoskeletal diseases, toxicology, fibrosis. We work on cardiovascular, congenital anomalies, cardiopulmonary anomalies, limb development, all related to our interest on the lateral plate mesoderm,\" says Mosimann. \"And then together, you get to make such fundamental discoveries. And that's where team science enables us to do something that is more than just the sum of the parts.\"For all the considerable work and significance of the study, the Mosimann team recognizes that it is a key step, but not the end of the journey in the debate about paired appendages.\"I wouldn't say we've solved the question, or even disproven either existing theory,\" says Lalonde. \"Rather, we've contributed meaningful data towards answering a major evolutionary question.\" More information:Tom Carney, A lateral plate mesoderm derived from median fin and the origin of paired fins, Nature (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the period of adaptation that humans went through?",
    "text": "Most scientists agree modern humans developed in Africa, more than 200,000 years ago, and that a great human diaspora across much of the rest of the world occurred between perhaps 60,000 and 50,000 years ago.          In new research published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, we have uncovered dozens of distinctive historical changes in the human genome to reveal a new chapter in this story.Our work suggests there may have been a previously unknown phase of humanity's great migration: an \"Arabian standstill\" of up to 30,000 years in which humans settled in and around the Arabian Peninsula. These humans slowly adapted to life in the region's colder climate before venturing to Eurasia and beyond.The legacy of these adaptations still lingers. Under modern conditions, many genetic changes from this period are linked to diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders.History in our genomesSince the first human genome was published in 2000, the amount of human genomic data available has grown exponentially. These rapidly growing datasets contain traces of key events in human history. Researchers have been actively developing new techniques to find those traces.When ancient humans left Africa and moved around the globe, they likely met new environments and challenges. New pressures would have led to adaptation and genetic changes. These changes would subsequently have been inherited by modern humans.Previous research on genomic data shows ancient humans most likely left Africa and spread across the planet between 60,000 and 50,000 years ago.However, we still don't know much about genetic adaptations during this crucial time period.Ancient adaptation eventsOur team of evolutionary and medical researchers has shed new light on this period. By studying both ancient and modern genomes, we have shown genetic selection was probably an important facilitator of this ancient human diaspora.Using ancient human genomes makes it possible to recover evidence of past events in which specific genetic variants were strongly favored over others and swept through a population. These \"hard sweep\" events are surprisingly rare in modern human genomes, most likely because their traces have been erased or distorted by subsequent mixing between populations.However, in earlier work we identified 57 regions in the human genome where an initially rare beneficial genetic variant effectively replaced an older variant in ancient Eurasian groups.In our new study, we reconstructed the historical spread of these genetic variants. We also estimated the temporal and geographical origins of the underlying selection pressures.Further, we identified the gene in each hard sweep region most likely to have been selected for. Knowing these genes helped us understand the ancient pressures that may have led to their selection.      Coping with coldOur findings suggest early humans went through a period of extensive adaptation, lasting up to 30,000 years, before the big diaspora between 60,000 and 50,000 years ago. This period of adaptation was followed by rapid dispersal across Eurasia and as far as Australia.We call this period the \"Arabian standstill.\" Genetic, archaeological and climatic evidence all suggest these ancient humans were most likely living in and around the Arabian Peninsula.The genetic adaptations involved parts of the genome related to fat storage, nerve development, skin physiology, and tiny hair-like fibers in our airways called cilia. These adaptations share striking functional similarities with those found in humans and other mammals living in the Arctic today.We also detected similar functional similarities with previously identified human adaptive genes derived from historical mixing events with Neanderthals and Denisovans. These distant relatives of humans are also thought to have adapted to cold Eurasian climates.Overall, these changes seem likely to have been driven by adaptation to the cool and dry climates in and around prehistoric Arabia between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago. The changes would also have prepared the ancient humans for the cold Eurasian climates they would eventually encounter.Old adaptations, modern diseasesMany of these adaptive genes have links to modern diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. The adaptations around the human expansion from Africa may have established genetic variations that, under modern conditions, are associated with common diseases.As we have suggested in another study, genes that were adaptive in the past might contribute to modern human susceptibility to various diseases. Identifying the genetic targets of historical adaptation events could help the development of therapeutic approaches and preventive measures for contemporary populations.Our findings contribute to a new but growing literature highlighting the importance of adaptation in shaping human history. They also show the growing potential of evolutionary genetics for medical research.

    "text": "A trio of macro-biologists and life scientists, two with Queen's University Belfast and the third with Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, has found that the modern \"sixth mass extinction\" event is going to be even worse than prior research has shown.          In their study, reported in the journal Biological Reviews, Catherine Finn, Daniel Pincheira-Donoso and Florencia Grattarola, analyzed population trend data for more than 71,000 animal species to learn more about declines.Over the past several decades, it has become clear that global biodiversity has been declining due to human activities including conversion of habitat, use of pesticides and herbicides and more recently, climate change. It is not known how many species are extinct due to such activities, but scientists have been trying to track species at highest risk of disappearing.One organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), has been assigning labels to species to assess extinction risk. But such lists, the researchers with this new effort note, only show which species are currently at risk of disappearing\u2014they do not show the drop in population levels of species that are not currently at risk of going extinct. To learn more about such trends, the researchers analyzed available population data for more than 70,000 species around the world to see how their numbers have changed since recordkeeping first began.They found that 48% of species have declining populations and just 3% have rising populations. They also found evidence showing that 33% of species currently classified as nonthreatened on the IUCN Red List are actually spiraling toward extinction.The researchers also found that as a group, amphibians are seeing the greatest drops in population. And while they found declines for birds, mammals and insects, they found it was less severe among reptiles and fish. They also found that declines were steeper in the tropics, noting that species in such areas tend to be more sensitive to change.The team concludes that the planet is approaching a mass extinction event far graver than prior research has suggested.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the group of geckos that have incredibly fragile skin?",
    "text": "Mammals are a bit odd when it comes to bones. Rather than the bony plates and scales of crocodiles, turtles, lizards, dinosaurs and fish, mammals long ago traded in their ancestral suit of armor for a layer of insulating hair.          Armadillos, with their protective and flexible shell of imbricated bone, are considered the only living exception. But a new study, published in the journal iScience, unexpectedly shows that African spiny mice produce the same structures beneath the skin of their tails, which until now had gone largely undetected.The discovery was made during routine CT scanning of museum specimens for the openVertebrate program, an initiative to provide 3D models of vertebrate organisms for researchers, educators and artists.\"I was scanning a mouse specimen from the Yale Peabody Museum, and the tails looked abnormally dark,\" said co-author Edward Stanley, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's digital imaging laboratory.He initially assumed the discoloration was caused by an imperfection introduced during the specimen's preservation. But when he analyzed the X-rays several days later, Stanley observed an unmistakable feature he was intimately familiar with.\"My entire Ph.D. was focused on osteoderm development in lizards. Once the specimen scans had been processed, the tail was very clearly covered in osteoderms.\"Spiny mice osteoderms have been observed at least once before and were noted by German biologist Jochen Niethammer, who compared their architecture to medieval stonework in an article published in 1975. Niethammer correctly interpreted the plates as being a type of bone but never followed up on his initial observations, and the group was largely overlooked for several decades\u2014until scientists discovered another, seemingly unrelated peculiarity of spiny mice.A study from 2012 demonstrated spiny mice can completely regenerate injured tissue without scarring, an ability common in reptiles and invertebrates but previously unknown in mammals. Their skin is also particularly fragile, tearing at roughly one-fourth the amount of force required to injure the skin of a common mouse. But spiny mice can heal twice as fast as their relatives.      Researchers hoping to find a model for human tissue regeneration have begun mapping the genetic pathways that give spiny mice their extraordinary powers of healing. One such researcher, Malcolm Maden, just so happened to have a lab in the building across from Stanley's office.\"Spiny mice can regenerate skin, muscle, nerves, spinal cord and perhaps even cardiac tissue, so we maintain a colony of these rare creatures for research,\" said Maden, a biology professor at the University of Florida and lead author on the study.Maden and his colleagues analyzed the development of spiny mice osteoderms, confirming they were in fact similar to those of armadillos but had most likely evolved independently. Osteoderms are also distinct from the scales of pangolins or the quills of hedgehogs and porcupines, which are composed of keratin, the same tissue that makes up hair, skin and nails.There are four genera of spiny mice, which all belong to the subfamily Deomyinae. However, aside from similarities in their DNA and potentially the shape of their teeth, scientists have been unable to find a single feature shared among species of this group that distinguishes them from other rodents.Stanley, suspecting their differences might only be skin deep, scanned additional museum specimens from all four genera. In each, he found spiny mice tails were covered in the same sheath of bone. The closest relatives of Deomyinae\u2014gerbils\u2014lacked osteoderms, meaning the trait had likely evolved just once, in the ancestor of erstwhile disparate spiny mice.The ubiquity of osteoderms in the group indicate they serve an important protective function. Just what that function might be wasn't immediately apparent, however, due to yet another peculiar attribute of spiny mice: Their tails are uncharacteristically detachable. Tail loss is so common in some spiny mouse species that nearly half the individuals of a given population have been shown to lack them in the wild.\"This was a real head-scratcher,\" Stanley said. \"Spiny mice are famously able to deglove their tails, meaning the outer layer of skin comes off, leaving behind the muscle and bone. Individuals will often chew off the remainder of the tail when this happens.\"Despite their powers of regeneration, tail shedding is a trick that spiny mice can only perform once. Unlike some lizards, they can't regrow their tails, and not every part of the tail separates easily.To find out why rodents that seem ambivalent about keeping their tails would go through the trouble of covering them in armor, the authors turned to a group of similarly odd fish-tale geckos from Madagascar. Most geckos lack osteoderms, but as their name implies, fish-tale geckos are covered in thin, overlapping plates, and just like spiny mice, they have incredibly fragile skin that sheds at the slightest provocation.According to Stanley, the osteoderms in fish-tale geckos and spiny mice possibly function like a type of escape mechanism.\"If a predator bites down on the tail, the armor might keep the teeth from sinking into the tissue beneath, which doesn't detach,\" he said. The outer skin and its complement of bone plating pull away from the tail when attacked, affording the mouse a quick escape.

A molecule that was initially developed to treat tuberculosis but failed to progress out of the lab as an antibiotic is now showing promise as a powerful foe for weeds that invade our gardens and cost farmers billions of dollars each year.While the failed antibiotic wasn't fit for its original purpose, scientists at the University of Adelaide discovered that by tweaking its structure, the molecule became effective at killing two of the most problematic weeds in Australia, annual ryegrass and wild radish, without harming bacterial and human cells. This research has been published in the journal Communications Biology.\"This discovery is a potential game changer for the agricultural industry. Many weeds are now resistant to the existing herbicides on the market, costing farmers billions of dollars each year,\" said lead researcher Dr. Tatiana Soares da Costa from the University of Adelaide's Waite Research Institute.\"Using failed antibiotics as herbicides provides a short-cut for faster development of new, more effective weed killers that target damaging and invasive weeds that farmers find hard to control.\"Researchers at the University's Herbicide and Antibiotic Innovation Lab discovered there were similarities between bacterial superbugs and weeds at a molecular level.They exploited these similarities, and by chemically modifying the structure of a failed antibiotic, they were able to block the production of amino acid lysine, which is essential for weed growth.

They specifically target weeds, with no effects on human cells,\" she said.It's not just farmers who could reap the benefits of this discovery. Researchers say it could also lead to the development of new weed killers to target pesky weeds growing in our backyards and driveways.\"Our re-purposing approach has the potential to discover herbicides with broad applications that can kill a variety of weeds,\" said Dr. Barrow.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the fungal disease that has been ravaging frog populations for 40 years?",
    "text": "For the past 40 years, a devastating fungal disease has been ravaging frog populations around the world, wiping out 90 species. Unlike the global COVID-19 pandemic, you may not even be aware of this \"panzootic\"\u2014a pandemic in the animal world. Yet it's the world's worst wildlife disease.          Recently published in the journal Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, a multinational study has now developed a method to detect all known strains of this disease, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus. This breakthrough will advance our ability to detect and research this disease, working towards a widely available cure.An extreme mortality rateChytridiomycosis, or \"chytrid\" for short, has driven severe declines in over 500 frog species and caused 90 extinctions, including seven in Australia.The extreme rate of mortality, and the high number of species affected, makes chytrid unequivocally the deadliest animal disease known to date.Chytrid infects frogs by reproducing in their skin. The single-celled fungus enters a skin cell, multiplies, then breaks back out onto the surface of the animal. This damage to the skin affects the frog's ability to balance water and salt levels, and eventually leads to death if infection levels are high enough.Chytrid originated in Asia. It's believed that global travel and trade in amphibians led to the disease being unwittingly spread to other continents.Frogs in regions such as Australia and the Americas did not have the evolutionary history with chytrid that could grant them resistance. So, when they were exposed to this new pathogen, the results were devastating.Many species' immune systems were simply not equipped to defend against the disease, and mass mortalities ensued. In the 1980s, amphibian biologists began to notice sharp population declines, and in 1998, the chytrid fungal pathogen was finally recognized as the culprit.Since then, much research has focused on infection trends and how to protect vulnerable frog species. To track such trends, we need a reliable way to detect chytrid in the first place.      An imperfect swabTo find out if a frog is carrying chytrid, researchers swab the animal and run the same type of test you might recognize from COVID-19 testing\u2014a qPCR. It stands for quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and simply put, is a way to measure the volume of DNA from a species of interest. The test was developed at CSIRO in 2004; unlike a COVID test, however, scientists swab the frog's skin, not the nose.Because this test was developed from chytrid in Australia, decades after the pathogen's arrival in the country, a divergence between the Australian and Asian strains meant this test could not detect chytrid in its region of origin. This has been a major limitation to the past two decades of chytrid research.Over the past several years, a team led by researchers at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research\u2014Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in India has been working on a new qPCR test that can detect strains of chytrid from Asia. In collaboration with researchers in Australia and Panama, we have now verified the new test also reliably detects chytrid in these countries.Furthermore, the test can detect another closely related species of chytrid that infects salamanders. The test is also more sensitive, meaning it can detect very low infection levels\u2014thereby broadening the scope of species we can study.Natural immunity?The most puzzling thing about chytrid is that some amphibian species\u2014even those that have not evolved with the pathogen\u2014don't become sick when they carry the fungus. These species have some form of natural immune resistance.However, frog immunity is extremely complex. Immunity might come from anti-microbial chemicals within the skin, symbiotic bacteria on the skin, white blood cells and antibodies in the blood, or combinations of these mechanisms.So far, no clear trend has been found between resistance and immune function. To make matters more complicated, there is also evidence chytrid can suppress a host's immune response.Because there haven't been any observed chytrid declines in Asia, and because detecting chytrid in Asia has been difficult, Asia is lagging behind the rest of the world in chytrid research. Yet the new qPCR test detected high levels of chytrid in a range of amphibian species across India.Having the ability to study chytrid in its region of origin may help us understand how Asian species evolved resistance\u2014research that may hold a key to help researchers develop a cure for those species in Australia, North and South America, and Europe that are now on the brink.While the new qPCR test was successful at detecting chytrid in samples from India, Australia, and Panama, we will need to validate and promote the method so it becomes the new gold standard for chytrid testing. Future work will involve using the test to analyze samples from Europe, and samples from Brazil where genetic studies show that chytrid has diverged.In time, this new way to detect chytrid could be the first step in helping to save frogs\u2014the hidden gems of our forests and wetlands.

    "text": "When most people consider the arctic, or high-altitude mountain landscapes, they think of endless snow, ice and bare rock. But pastel-colored flowers, sometimes just a few millimeters wide, bloom in these dramatic places too. The miniature flowers not only weather some of the toughest habitats on Earth, but can also help engineer the landscape for other species.          Don't be fooled by their delicate petals. Some species of rock jasmine and sandwort grow at well over 6,000 meters on Mount Everest, while purple saxifrage flourishes on the northernmost point of land in the world\u2014Kaffeklubben Island, north of Greenland\u2014and throughout the Arctic, Alaska and the tips of the European Alps.Plants in freezing cold environments are typically small and often form as ground-hugging rosettes, or dense tufts with short stems, known as cushions. Antarctic pearlwort sits no more than 5cm high and displays a tight bunch of minute yellow blooms. The summits of the Scottish Highlands, where temperatures can drop to -27\u2103 in winter, are home to tiny flowers also found in the Arctic, such as moss campion, dwarf willow, trailing azalea and starry saxifrage.Although plants such as these may appear fragile, their minute size helps them cope with freezing weather and fierce winds. Low stature and tightly packed leaves act as an aerodynamic trap and storage system for water and solar radiation. Microspaces within the dense, dome-like foliage are efficient structures for retaining moisture and heat. An arctic-alpine cushion's internal temperature can be 15\u00b0C warmer than its surroundings. Pioneer plants                Trailing azalea has tiny pink flowers. Credit: Sarah Watts, Author provided             Cushion plants and mosses can be integral to their local environment (known as keystone species) and ecosystem engineers because they stabilize their harsh microclimate, and are often the first to colonize bare ground. As the cushions grow, they improve the moisture and nutrient content of thin soils by accumulating organic material both directly within the plant itself, and through their root systems. By buffering temperature extremes, cushions reduce the frost risk in their immediate surroundings. These processes create a habitat more suitable for less stress-tolerant plant species including arctic-alpines in the daisy and pea families.Cushion formers are therefore vital \"nurse\" plants in mountain and polar regions. They also shelter small arthropods including beetles and tiny wingless insects called springtails.These animals may in turn pollinate the plants they take refuge in, and provide food for others higher up the food chain.      An alarming trendHowever, these tiny arctic-alpine plants are now sounding a warning bell for the loss of biodiversity (the richness and variety of living things on earth) due to climate change. The plants have an important relationship with snow, which offers them protection from disturbance and erosion. But rising temperatures are causing earlier snow melt, allowing the spread of other species previously restricted to lower altitudes and latitudes. Consequently, taller generalist plants, such as common grasses and sedges are crowding out the smaller arctic-alpines.                Moss campion is a mountain wildflower. Credit: Sarah Watts, Author provided             High mountain areas are warming at twice the global average and are geographically isolated from other places with similar climates, leaving the specialist flowers nowhere to relocate to.Arctic-alpine plant numbers are plummeting in Britain and climate change is impacting numbers across the world, threatening the future of species that depend on them. Snow pearlwort, a cushion plant usually no bigger than a penny, is the first flowering plant in Britain to have its International Union Conservation of Nature status moved from vulnerable to endangered due to climate change. Our research using long-term monitoring data from the Scottish Highlands has shown that snow pearlwort, mountain sandwort and drooping saxifrage are withdrawing uphill and face mountaintop extinction because there is no higher ground left for them to retreat to as temperatures rise.If we lose these plants from their British mountaintop outposts\u2014at the edge of where they occur globally\u2014this will signal that their strongholds in the Arctic and the Alps are also in danger.Polar and mountain regions are havens for biodiversity, nurturing species found nowhere else in the world. We risk losing the cultural and inspirational value that rare species give us, with implications for the preservation of our natural heritage.Plants are the building blocks of habitats and food webs on which other lifeforms across the planet depend, but they are frequently overlooked in conservation news stories. There's a name for this phenomenon\u2014plant blindness. Scientists, nature writers and the media usually turn to trees or species with large colorful flowers to open people's eyes to the importance of plant life.But we must celebrate and protect our tiniest of plants. If we don't the spectrum of diversity across earth's extremes will be lost for generations to come.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the whale that was sunk by a boat?",
    "text": "Orcas living off Europe's Iberian coast recently struck and sunk a yacht in the Strait of Gibraltar. Scientists suspect that this is the third vessel this subpopulation of killer whales has capsized since May 2020, when a female orca believed to be the originator of this behavior suffered a traumatic encounter with a boat.          In most reported cases, orcas are biting, bending and breaking off the rudders of sailboats. So how did they learn to imitate this behavior\u2014and why? We asked Dr. Luke Rendell, who researches learning, behavior and communication among marine mammals at the University of St Andrews.Why do you think orcas appear to be attacking boats off the Iberian coast?Any answer that I (or anyone else, really) give to this question is speculation\u2014we just don't know enough about killer whale motivations to be certain. The puzzle for biologists is to understand how this behavior developed.The lack of obvious fitness-enhancing rewards (like food, for example) means this is unlikely to have evolved because it enabled the whales to better survive in their environment. That is what we would call an adaptive trait: it confers a direct evolutionary benefit by helping the animal find food, mate, or successfully raise offspring.But I can say what this behavior looks like. There are multiple accounts of single and groups of orcas developing idiosyncratic and not obviously adaptive habits. These range from one group engaging in what seemed like a short-term fad of carrying dead salmon on their heads, to another vocally mimicking sea lions (there may be an adaptive outcome to convincing sea lions that you are a sea lion too, not a voracious predator, but there's no evidence of this occurring).There are other kinds of behavior that do appear to bring rewards\u2014for example, captive orcas learning to regurgitate fish to use as bait for gulls, which they apparently prefer to eat over the fish. But the origin and spread of these boat attacks currently fits very well with the characterization of a temporary fad, and it remains to be seen how long it persists.If instead there is an adaptive explanation, my hunch is it has to do with curiosity sometimes leading to important innovations around food sources, which can then be shared.How do you suspect this behavior is being transmitted among killer whales in the region?This behavior probably started with individual orcas, but would appear to spread through social learning. We recently published a paper on a similar fad-like behavior in bottlenose dolphins, where we identified the dolphin that promoted a tail-walking behavior it had acquired during a temporary period of captivity.This is pretty similar to the account of an academic journal on the recent yacht sinking, in that a specific individual was identified as the potential source. This orca was prompted to engage in the behavior due to a past trauma\u2014perhaps being struck by a boat rudder, according to the account.The precise reason is very hard to know for sure, but we do know the behavior has spread through her group. And it's difficult to explain that dynamic without involving some kind of social learning\u2014the spread of information.      Is there evidence of killer whales behaving this way in the past?I have experienced orcas swimming very close to our boat in the waters near St Vincent, in the eastern Caribbean, during a research survey. Our vessel, like those involved in these interactions, was about the size of a large whale (a humpback, for instance). Maybe they were investigating us, but it never escalated to any kind of physical interaction.My impression was that they were interested in the boat's propeller, and the currents it created\u2014they came so close on one occasion that we had to take the engine out of gear to prevent an injury. So, approaching boats is not novel. Damaging them in such a determined way is, however, not something I have ever heard orcas do before.It is, of course, known to happen in other species\u2014notably sperm whales, giving rise to the story of Moby Dick: a combination of accounts of a white whale off the South American coast dubbed \"Mocha Dick,\" and the account of the whaler Essex, sunk by a large sperm whale in equatorial waters.The subpopulation of orcas responsible for these attacks is critically endangered. Do you think the group's conservation status is relevant in some way?I don't think it's particularly relevant to the origin and spread of the behavior, but it is highly relevant to how we should manage this population.If these killer whales continue attacking boats, it will make protecting them harder. Not only does interacting with revolving propellers increase the risk of injury to these animals, it also threatens people\u2014from the injuring of crews to the sinking of vessels\u2014which will create political pressure for something to be done.Of course, small vessel operators do not need to navigate the areas along the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Portugal where these interactions with orcas have been happening. Preventing them from doing so would solve the problem\u2014but for many boat operators and owners, this is their shortest route, while heading offshore makes for riskier passages. A loss of tourism revenue if these vessels stop will add to pressure for a permanent solution.It is possible that some will call for these orcas to be controlled, up to and including having them killed if they continue to threaten human life and livelihoods. This poses significant ethical questions about our relationship with these animals.Should we, as the species that ultimately holds the greatest power, vacate small, vulnerable vessels from the orcas' habitat as part of a shifting relationship to the sea, which we know is deteriorating as a result of our actions? Or should we confer on ourselves the right to navigate as we please and control any nonhuman animals that impede it, up to and including culling them?Historically, the latter view would almost certainly have prevailed, and perhaps it will here. But it is a question which society, rather than scientists, must answer, and it will be telling which way the relevant authorities ultimately turn.Reports indicate a 'traumatised' victim of a boat collision initiated the behavior. Are notions of solidarity and self-defense among killer whales outlandish?I regard this as plausible speculation. The authors of the recent paper cast it as one of a number of assumptions about how the behavior might have developed, with generally increased pressure on their habitat and the idea of natural curiosity as other options (the latter is what I think is most likely).Notions of collective self-defense in cetaceans (aquatic mammals including whales, dolphins and porpoises) are far from outlandish. We have accounts of sperm whales rising to each other's defense when orcas attack, for example. Solidarity is a more subjective issue, and we don't have access to the internal mental states of these animals to really understand whether this is going on.I can, however, point to a different cetacean: humpback whales apparently aid other species, notably seals, that are under attack from orcas. The scientist who led the description of this behavior, Robert Pitman, said he regards it as \"inadvertent altruism\" based on a simple rule of thumb: \"When you hear a killer whale attack, go break it up.\"These accounts raise interesting questions about the motivations behind orcas attacking boats that we cannot yet answer. It is not impossible that these orcas perceive their own common aggressor in us\u2014but it is also entirely possible they have no such concept.

New Zealanders have been appalled by revelations that Zoo Miami allowed visitors to pet one of the shy nocturnal animals under harsh lights.Zoo Miami issued an apology on Tuesday and said it had scrapped the interactive pet-a-kiwi experience, but not before videos of a kiwi named Paora being stroked and petted went viral.\"The zoo (has) immediately taken steps to address the concerns that were raised,\" New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said.\"They have acknowledged that what they were doing wasn't appropriate or wasn't right or wasn't fair to the kiwi,\" he added. \"I thank them for taking it seriously.\"Millions of kiwis used to roam before Western settlers arrived on the shores of New Zealand, where only around 70,000 are now left in the wild.The Zoo Miami bird is only one of around 60 kiwis currently housed outside of New Zealand, according to the Department of Conservation.Kiwis are part of Maori mythology in New Zealand, where there was fierce condemnation of Paora's treatment.\"It is obviously very clear your team (at Zoo Miami) is not equipped and has no clue how to care for this national treasure. Return Immediately, Paora,\" one person fumed on Twitter.\"Sell kiwi toys if you want to fundraise! This is unethical and cruel,\" wrote another user.In a statement, Zoo Miami said the \"concerns expressed have been taken very seriously\".\"Effective immediately, the Kiwi Encounter will no longer be offered,\" the zoo added.\"It's especially painful to all of us to think that anything that has occurred with Paora... would be offensive to any of the wonderful people of New Zealand.\"The zoo said it planned to build \"a special habitat\" for Paora so it could teach visitors about \"the amazing kiwi\" without direct contact.The Miami zoo hatched the bird, which is named after Moari iwi (tribe) leader and environmentalist Paora Haitana.Haitana told Radio New Zealand that it was \"a huge concern\" to hear of his namesake's treatment.\"It's our signature, we're known as the kiwi, so it goes against everything the bird was given to them for,\" Haitana added.New Zealand's Department of Conservation said it would contact Zoo Miami to \"share our expertise and high standards for the respectful care of kiwi\".A spokesperson added that they also planned to raise the matter with the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, of which Zoo Miami is a member.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Miami zoo's meet-a-kiwi scheme ruffles feathers in New Zealand (2023, May 24)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-miami-zoo-meet-a-kiwi-scheme-ruffles.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "The Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Center at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama partnered with the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in India to develop and validate a new test for chytridiomycosis strains, offering new insights into a wildlife disease that caused dramatic declines of over 500 amphibian species and the extinction of 90 others. Their novel assay, published in the journal Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, identified previously undetected Indian strains, and successfully detected strains from other parts of the world.          The new diagnostic assay was tested with frogs, toads, caecilians (limbless amphibians) and salamanders (tailed amphibians) in India, with comparable or even better results than the gold-standard assay recommended for the diagnosis of chytridiomycosis. Its effectivity was successfully verified in labs in Panama and Australia, proving it to be an affordable alternative for the widespread surveillance of chytridiomycosis in different parts of the world.Rapid detection of chytridiomycosis is essential in managing and mitigating the disease. But ongoing research on this infection caused by two fungal pathogens reveals a complex, dynamically evolving genome. As new strains evolve in different parts of the world and spread through the global trade of amphibians, large-scale surveillance for emerging hybrid varieties is necessary. The newly developed assay will aid global detection, highlighting the value of international scientific collaborations in the search for solutions to a common threat.\"This assay will allow researchers to study and determine the spread of strains of the amphibian chytrid fungus that previously passed undetected, especially in countries around the Indian Ocean, where human trade has moved and introduced frog species,\" said STRI scientist Roberto Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, who collaborated in the study.The new test may also aid in the detection of pathogen reservoirs that have not been identified yet. That is, amphibian species that may be infected but do not show visible symptoms of disease or mortality and are able to silently transmit the disease to other susceptible species in their surroundings.\"One strain of the amphibian chytrid fungus caused dramatic population declines, even the disappearance of amphibian species in Panama,\" said co-author Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. \"The Chiriqu\u00ed harlequin frog (Atelopus chiriquiensis) and the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) have not been seen for several years. A few species of frogs have reappeared in some localities, but they have not fully recovered their previous population levels. The amphibian chytrid fungus is still a threat for susceptible species in natural areas.\"The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, headquartered in Panama City, Panama, is part of the Smithsonian Institution.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the invasive species that is killing sea urchins in the Mediterranean?",
    "text": "A series of new, disturbing studies from Tel Aviv University reveals a deadly epidemic causing mass mortality of black sea urchins in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. The entire population of black sea urchins in Eilat was wiped out over a couple of months. For example, thousands of sea urchins living in a site near the northern shore of the Gulf of Eilat died out over the course of a few weeks. The epidemic was so severe, that today no living black sea urchins have remained at the site, only skeletons. The same has happened at other sites in the Gulf of Eilat. The studies note that such extensive mortality is also occurring in other countries in the region, including Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Greece, and Turkey.          The researchers emphasize that sea urchins in general, and the long-spined Diadema setosum in particular, are considered key species essential for the healthy functioning of the coral reef. The researchers caution, \"It must be understood that the threat to coral reefs is already at an all-time peak, and now a previously unknown variable has been added. This situation is unprecedented in the entire documented history of the Gulf of Eilat.\"The researchers assume that the source of the deadly epidemic is a pathogenic ciliate parasite that has spread from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. An urgent report describing the current situation was submitted to the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, and emergency steps for protecting Israel's coral reefs are now under consideration.The studies were led by Dr. Omri Bronstein and Ph.D. students Rotem Zirler, Lisa-Maria Schmidt, Gal Eviatar, and Lachan Roth from the School of Zoology, Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, and The Steinhardt Museum of Natural History at Tel Aviv University. The papers were published in Frontiers in Marine Science and Royal Society Open Science.Dr. Bronstein explains, \"At first we thought it was some kind of pollution or poisoning, or a local chemical spill, from the industry and hotels in the north of the Gulf of Eilat, but when we examined additional sites in Eilat, Jordan, and Sinai, we quickly realized that this was not a local incident. All findings pointed to a rapidly spreading epidemic. Similar reports are coming in from colleagues in Saudi Arabia. Even sea urchins that we grow for research purposes in our aquariums at the Interuniversity Institute, and sea urchins at the Underwater Observatory Marine Park in Eilat, contracted the disease and died, probably because the pathogen got in through the pumping systems. It's a fast and violent death: Within just two days a healthy sea urchin becomes a skeleton with massive tissue loss. While some corpses are washed ashore, most sea urchins are devoured while they are dying and unable to defend themselves, which could speed up contagion by the fish who prey on them.\"      Dr. Bronstein continues, \"In recent years my research group has been studying the issue of marine invasions. One of the species we focus on is the long-spined Diadema setosum. Until recently this was one of the dominant species in Eilat's coral reef\u2014the black sea urchins with long spines familiar to all of us. Sea urchins in general, and Diadema setosum in particular, are considered key species essential for the healthy functioning of coral reefs. The sea urchins are the reef's 'gardeners'\u2014they feed on the algae and prevent them from taking over and suffocating the corals that compete with them for sunlight. Unfortunately, these sea urchins no longer exist in the Gulf of Eilat and are quickly disappearing from constantly expanding parts of the Red Sea further south.\"The first reports on mass mortality reached Dr. Bronstein several months ago, from colleagues in Greece and Turkey, which the sea urchins had invaded, probably through the Suez Canal.                Fish feeding on a D. setosum urchin carcass in the Mediterranean Sea. Credit: Tel Aviv University             \"In 2006 the first sea urchin of this species was discovered in the south of Turkey,\" adds Dr. Bronstein. \"This phenomenon, known as biological invasion, has extensive ecological implications, and is widespread in the eastern Mediterranean, especially along Israel's coastline. We have been tracking the dynamics of this species' invasion in the Mediterranean since its first appearance. In 2016 we discovered the first Diadema setosum sea urchin along Israel's Mediterranean coastline\u2014a single urchin at the Gordon Beach in Tel Aviv. For over a decade since the first discovery in Turkey, populations in the Mediterranean remained small and usually hidden. But since 2018 the sea urchin population in the Mediterranean has been growing exponentially, reaching a state of population explosion\u2014with giant populations of thousands and even tens of thousands found in Greece and Turkey.\"However, as we worked on studies summarizing the invasion of sea urchins in the Mediterranean, we began to receive reports on sudden extensive mortality. Supposedly the extinction of an invasive species is not a bad thing, but we must be aware of two major risks: First, we don't yet know how this mortality and its causes might impact local species in the Mediterranean; and second, and much more critical, the geographic proximity between the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea might enable the pathogen to quickly cross over to the natural population in the Red Sea. As we feared and predicted, this is what appears to have happened.\"The mass mortality reminded the TAU researchers of one of the most famous and devastating events in the history of marine ecology: the disappearance of the sea urchins in the Caribbean. Until 1983 the Caribbean coral reef was a thriving tropical reef, quite similar to the coral reef in the Gulf of Eilat. Once the sea urchins disappeared, the algae multiplied without control, blocked the sunlight from reaching the corals, and the entire reef changed irreversibly\u2014from a coral reef to an algae field.\"Last year the disease broke out again in the Caribbean, killing the surviving urchin populations and individuals,\" says Dr. Bronstein. \"Unlike past events, today we have the scientific and technological tools to analyze the forensic evidence. A group of researchers from Cornell University identified the cause of mortality in the Caribbean: a pathogenic ciliate parasite. The pathology observed in the sea urchins dying in Greece and Turkey is identical to the pathology in the Caribbean, and it's also the pathology we see in the sea urchins dying here in the Red Sea.\"                A dying D. setosum urchin. Credit: Tel Aviv University             Dr. Bronstein's studies were the first to identify mass mortality in an invasive species in the Mediterranean, and also the first to indicate mass mortality of sea urchins of the species Diadema setosum\u2014one of the world's most common species of sea urchins. Dr. Bronstein concluded one of these groundbreaking studies with a warning\u2014that the epidemic breaking out in the Mediterranean might spread to the nearby Red Sea. Unfortunately, this warning has come true.\"We must understand the seriousness of the situation: In the Red Sea, mortality is spreading at a stunning rate, and already encompasses a much larger area than we see in the Mediterranean. In the background there is still a great unknown: What is actually killing the sea urchins? Is it the Caribbean pathogen or some new unfamiliar factor? Either way, this pathogen is clearly carried by water, and we predict that in just a short time, the entire population of these sea urchins, in both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, will get sick and die.\"In my opinion, we must urgently establish a broodstock population for these sea urchins, so that if needed, we will be able to return them to nature in the future. As with COVID-19, at this point no one knows what will happen\u2014will this epidemic disappear by itself, or will it stay with us for many years and cause a dramatic change in coral reefs? However, unlike the COVID-19 pandemic, in this case we have no way of vaccinating or treating the sea urchins, and so we must focus all efforts on prevention. The window of opportunity for preserving a healthy population of this species in Eilat has already closed. If we want to establish a broodstock population, we must do it today, by preserving healthy individuals from the Israeli Mediterranean\u2014before the disease, spreading from the north, reaches this area. This is a complex task, but it is absolutely necessary if we wish to ensure the survival of this unique species that is so critical to the future of coral reefs.\" More information:Mass mortality of the invasive alien echinoid Diadema setosum (Echinoidea: Diadematidae) in the Mediterranean Sea, Royal Society Open Science (2023).

    "text": "In a study recently published in Nature Chemical Biology, researchers focused on para-nitro-L-phenylalanine (pN-Phe), a non-standard amino acid that is neither one of the twenty standard amino acids nor observed in nature. pN-Phe has been used by other research groups to help the immune system mount a response to proteins that it does not ordinarily respond to.          \"The nitro chemical functional group has valuable properties and has been underexplored by folks who are trying to rewire metabolism,\" Kunjapur said. \"pN-Phe also has a nice history in the literature\u2014it can be added onto a protein from a mouse, delivered back to mice, and the immune system will no longer tolerate the original version of that protein. That ability has promise for the treatment or prevention of diseases that are caused by rogue proteins that the immune system struggles to lock onto.\"Genetic code expansion methods allowed the researchers to increase the \"alphabet\" of available amino acids encoded by DNA. By coupling metabolic engineering techniques with genetic code expansion, the researchers were able to create a system that produces nitrated proteins autonomously.\"Because of the nitro functional group chemistry, the amino acid that we picked as our target for this project was unconventional, and many scientists within our field may not have expected that it could be made using biosynthesis,\" Kunjapur said.The next step for this research is to optimize their methods to synthesize higher amounts of nitrated proteins and expand this work into other microorganisms. The long-term goal is to further refine this platform for applications related to vaccines or immunotherapies.\"I think the implications are interesting, in that you can take a bacterium's central metabolism, its ability to produce different compounds, and with a few modifications you are able to expand its chemical repertoire,\" said Butler. \"The nitro functionality is rare in biology and absent from the standard 20 amino acids, but we showed bacterial metabolism is malleable enough that it can be rewired to create and integrate this functionality.\"Kunjapur added, \"Bacteria are potentially useful drug delivery vehicles.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the journal published by the University of Bayreuth?",
    "text": "Mountain biking is one of the most popular leisure activities today. Sport ecologists at the University of Bayreuth have now compiled and evaluated a wide range of previously published findings on the ecological consequences of this sport. Numerous direct and short-term effects on animals, plants and soils can be clearly demonstrated. However, estimates of long-term consequences remain difficult because of the complexity of ecosystems and their inherent dynamics. The review article was published in the journal Global Ecology and Conservation.          Particularly serious consequences can be observed when near-natural areas are first used for mountain biking. As soon as areas are opened up for mountain biking by creating new trails or mountain bikers enter intact flora and fauna on previously untraveled terrain, wild animals begin to change their behavior. Vegetation is visibly impacted, and the tendency for soil erosion increases. These effects are all the more striking because areas with a distinct landscape diversity are particularly attractive and used for outdoor sports such as mountain biking.One of the studies evaluated demonstrated a reduction in soil microbial biomass on a strip of terrain up to 20 meters adjacent to trails. This weakens the supply of nutrients to plants and therefore affects their growth and reproduction. The thinning of plant cover in turn increases soil erosion, which is in any case promoted by new, unpaved trails.However, consequences for vegetation do not only result from the construction of trails, but\u2014as further studies have shown\u2014also from the fact that mountain bikers leave the designated trails and use the adjacent terrain instead. How the relevance of the resulting damage is to be assessed always depends in each individual case on the respective protection status and the function of the affected plants.Destruction of plant cover in the terrain used for mountain biking is particularly relevant for endangered species, but can also have a beneficial effect on biodiversity.Mountain biking also has a direct impact on wildlife in many ways, as the overview of previous research shows. Often wildlife reacts to mountain biking by avoiding proximity to athletes and their trails. It is not uncommon for cycling to shorten their resting periods and interfere with their feeding at their usual times of day.Some species therefore change both their habitats and their daily rhythms. Such effects of mountain biking have been studied particularly frequently in mammals and birds. However, potential changes in behavior do not necessarily have negative effects on the population of the species in question.      In their review, the Bayreuth sport ecologists explicitly point to gaps in knowledge. Many aspects of the interactions between mountain biking, plants and animals have not been sufficiently studied and are likely to differ considerably between individual species. Also, little is known to date about the consequences of the rapidly growing popularity of electric-powered mountain bikes.\"There are indeed many indications that the environmental effects identified in previous studies are enhanced by e-mountain biking. However, a great deal of research is still needed before generally valid statements can be made. Not least, these would also have to investigate changes in sports behavior associated with the switch to electric-powered mountain bikes,\" said Veronika Mitterwallner, corresponding author of the review article and doctoral student at the Sport Ecology research group at the University of Bayreuth.The authors of the new publication emphasize that the knowledge available to date on the immediate environmental effects of mountain biking is seldom sufficient to enable conclusions to be drawn with regard to long-term consequences for ecological systems. In many cases, much more data than is available today would need to be collected to make reasoned conclusions about the nature and extent of potential long-term impacts.\"In principle, the effects of mountain biking can be expected to differ substantially among species and depending on context. The targeted investigation of rare species or species worthy of protection has so far often been insufficient, and the long-term relevance of short-term disturbances consequently remains open,\" said Mitterwallner.The Bayreuth sport ecologists also point out that outdoor sports such as mountain biking could contribute in the long term to sensitizing people to the aesthetic and ecological value of landscapes. In this case, these sports would even have the potential to strengthen a mindful, ecologically conscious approach to nature. More information:Lukas F.

But paleontologists are increasingly finding evidence that dinosaurs had even more elaborate head ornaments not preserved with the fossil skulls\u2014structures made of keratin, the stuff of fingernails, that were likely used as visual signals or semaphores to others of their kind.A newly described species of dome-headed dinosaur\u2014a pachycephalosaur dating from around 68 million years ago\u2014is the latest example. Pachycephalosaurs lived during the Cretaceous period, between about 130 and 66 million years ago, and tended to be small-to-medium-sized plant eaters. Ranging from 3 to 15 feet long, they walked on two legs and had a long, stiff tail for balance.The new species is based on a partial pachycephalosaur skull, including its bowling-ball shaped dome, that was unearthed in 2011 in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, which are layers of Upper Cretaceous rock from which paleontologists have collected dinosaur fossils for decades.Based on CT scans and microscopic analyses of slices through the fossilized dome, paleontologists Mark Goodwin of the University of California, Berkeley, and John \"Jack\" Horner of Chapman University in Orange, California, concluded that the skull likely had sported bristles of keratin, reminiscent of a brush cut.\"We don't know the exact shape of what was covering the dome, but it had this vertical component that we interpret as covered with keratin,\" Goodwin said, noting that a bristly, flat-topped covering \"biologically makes sense. Animals change or use certain features, particularly on the skull, for multiple functions\u2014it could be for display or for social and biological interactions involving visual communication.\"\"I would guess that there was something pretty elaborate up there,\" said Horner, a lecturer and presidential fellow at Chapman, professor emeritus at Montana State University in Bozeman and emeritus curator at the Museum of the Rockies.Peculiarly, the skull had a nasty gouge at the apex that had healed, indicating that a serious accident once befell the creature, but that it had survived long enough for new bone tissue to grow into the gash.\"We see probably the first unequivocal evidence of trauma in the head of any pachycephalosaur, where the bone was actually ejected from the dome somehow and healed partially in life,\" said Goodwin, emeritus assistant director and paleontologist at the UC Museum of Paleontology. \"We don't know how that was caused. It could be head-butting\u2014we don't dispute that.\"Goodwin and Horner caution that this head lesion, about a half-inch deep, is not a smoking gun for the storied hypothesis that these dinosaurs butted heads as part of their social interactions\u2014the Cretaceous equivalent of the way bighorn rams clash heads today. Instead, the injury could have been caused by anything from a falling rock to a chance encounter with a tree or another dinosaur.

Credit: Jack Horner and Mark Goodwin             \"That's the first place everybody wants to go\u2014let's crash them together. And, you know, we just don't see any evidence of it, histologically,\" Horner said, referring to detailed studies of the tissues underlying the dome, both in this specimen and in other pachycephalosaur skulls. \"Something hit the top of this guy's head and damaged it, and it was something that was severe. But having a defense mechanism on your head is not a good idea, not for anybody. Any features, any accouterments that we find on the heads of dinosaurs, I think, are all display\u2014it's all about display.\"Such ornamentation is common in the reptile ancestors of dinosaurs and their bird descendants; they're used both to attract mates and intimidate rivals. But Horner and Goodwin have long argued that the internal structure of pachycephalosaur skulls is not cushiony enough to allow head-butting without severe brain damage, and that head-butting is a mammal thing that is rarely seen in reptiles or birds. Specifically, pachycephalosaur skulls lack specializations, such as a pneumatic chamber above the braincase, as found in bighorn sheep, or other features present in mammals that engage in violent head-butting behavior.\"I don't see any reason to turn dinosaurs into mammals, rather than just trying to figure out what they might be doing as bird-like reptiles,\" Horner said.Horner, Goodwin and David Evans of the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada published their description of the new pachycephalosaur last month in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The team named the new species Platytholus clemensi, after the late UC Berkeley paleontologist William Clemens, who collected many fossils\u2014in particular mammalian fossils\u2014in the same Hell Creek Formation where the new species was found.      'A bowling ball in the fossil record'According to Horner and Goodwin, pachycephalosaur skulls are quite common in many dinosaur beds, though somewhat less so in the Hell Creek Formation, which dates from the late Cretaceous Period, a few million years before the asteroid or comet impact that lowered the curtain on dinosaurs and changed the trajectory of life on Earth. One primary reason for the skulls' ubiquity is the large bony dome.\"With pachycephalosaurs, think about a bowling ball in the fossil record,\" Goodwin said. \"Their skulls roll around, get buried, and when exposed on the surface, they're very robust, so they can withstand a lot of weathering and erosion sitting out there. More than once, people have walked over an area all summer and discovered that what they thought was just a rock, because it looks like a glacial cobble, turned out to be a really nice dome.\"Though Goodwin and Horner have unearthed many other fossils from the Hell Creek Formation over the past 45 to 50 years, including bones of Triceratops, T. rex and duckbilled hadrosaurs, they have a particular interest in pachycephalosaurs\u2014both their evolution and their development from juvenile to adult. They've sliced through many skulls to study how they change over time and to test the theory that the creatures butted heads with one another, or at least, that the males did.Their conclusion: There's no evidence, based on bone structure, that the skull or neck could withstand a head-to-head collision. The newly described partial skull, which was not found with other parts of the skeleton, also has a bone structure inconsistent with head-butting.Because the skull bones didn't look like specimens from any of the other two types of juvenile, sub-adult or adult pachycephalosaurs that lived in the area around the same time\u2014Pachycephalosaurus itself, after which these dinosaurs are named, and Sphaerotholus\u2014the paleontologists classified the animal as a new genus and species, Platytholus clemensi.                A CT scan of the dome reveals the well-organized vertical arrangement of the neurovascular network in the skull and dome of Platytholus clemensi, suggesting that the network fed verticle structures on top of the dome. (Scale bar is 2 centimeters). Credit: Jack Horner and Mark Goodwin             The skull did have characteristics that the paleontologists had seen in other pachycephalosaurs, including Sphaerotholus: blood vessels in the skull that ended abruptly at the surface of the dome, indicating that the blood originally fed some tissue that was sitting atop the dome. If that covering were a sheath of keratin, the blood vessels would have spread out and left indentations or grooves along the domed surface, as seen, for example, under the beaks of birds or on the skulls of Triceratops and other ceratopsians or horned dinosaurs. But the vessels were perpendicular to the surface, as if they fed a vertical structure.\"What we see are these vertical canals coming to the surface, which suggests that there might be keratin on top, but it's oriented vertically,\" said Horner. \"I think these pachycephalosaurs had something on top of their head that we don't know about. I don't think they were just domes. I think there was some elaborate display on top of their head.\"Goodwin noted that the shape of the domed heads of pachycephalosaurs changed as the animals matured, becoming more prominent and elaborate as they approached adulthood. That, too, would suggest they were used for sexual display and courting, though they may have been used to butt the flanks, as opposed to the heads, of male rivals. He suspects that dinosaurs likely distinguished gender by color, as do most modern birds, such as cassowaries, peafowls and toucans, which have bright integumental colors around the face and head for visual communication.\"It's reasonable to suggest that the covering over the dome may also have been brightly colored or subject to color change seasonally,\" he said.The paleontologists are obtaining CT scans and doing thin-section histology of other pachycephalosaur domes to determine whether other dome-headed dinosaurs may have displayed elaborate vertical headgear in addition to the known array of bumps, nodes and horns.\"The combination of cranial histology after thin-sectioning the skull and CT scanning gave us a much richer body of data and forms a basis for our hypothesis that there was a keratinous covering over the dome,\" Goodwin said. \"We know the dome was covered with something, and we make a hypothesis, at least in this taxon, that it had a vertical structural component, unlike Triceratops, T. rex and other dinosaurs, which had hard skin or keratin closely covering the bone.\"Goodwin and Horner named the new species after Clemens because both developed close ties to him over the many summers all three explored Montana in search of Cretaceous fossils, sometimes working side by side in the field.\"Bill Clemens was a very important person in Mark's life, but he may have been more important in my life because he was the person who, back in 1978, said, 'You know, Jack, there's this woman in Bynum, Montana, who found a large dinosaur, and she needs it identified,'\" Horner said. When he and colleague Bob Makela checked out the woman's rock shop, Horner said, she asked about a few smaller fossils in her shop, too, which turned out to be \"the first baby dinosaur bones found in the world.\"That discovery provided the first clear evidence that some dinosaurs cared for their young and led Horner to write several books about family structure among duckbilled dinosaurs, including \"Digging Dinosaurs\" in 1988 and a sequel, \"Dinosaur Lives: Unearthing an Evolutionary Saga,\" in 1997. He also wrote several children's books, including \"Maia: A Dinosaur Grows Up,\" in 1995, about a baby duckbill of the species Horner named Maiasaura, and the 2023 sequel, \"Lily and Maia....a Dinosaur Adventure.\"\"I owe a great amount of gratitude to Bill Clemens for sending me on that little trip,\" said Horner.

    "question_squad": " What is the largest estuary in the world?",
    "text": "Planting forests with diverse species can help ensure their success, according to a new study published May 18 from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) and The Nature Conservancy. The discovery is the result of a decade of research from BiodiversiTREE, a large-scale reforestation project at SERC designed to run for 100 years, testing the effects of different tree planting strategies on sapling survival and other ecosystem functions.          The study is published in the journal Restoration Ecology.Forests are naturally diverse, and this diversity of plant species brings an array of benefits: pest and disease resistance, resilience to climate change and increased wildlife habitat. However, nearly all forest plantations, and some restoration projects, are planted as monocultures\u2014where a single plant species is grown on the land. This practice leaves both managed and unmanaged forests ecologically and economically vulnerable to changing conditions. Another disadvantage of monocultures is the risk of planting failure\u2014where a sapling fails to thrive\u2014and early mortality.Hundreds of scientific studies have shown that biodiversity enhances ecosystem function, suggesting that diversity in tree plantings could improve their survival outcomes. Yet there have been few tests of this hypothesis on trees. Scientists designed BiodiversiTREE to test whether tree diversity impacts ecosystem function\u2014the largest experiment of its kind in North America.In 2013, scientists and 100 volunteers created BiodiversiTREE by planting 20,000 saplings on former agricultural land near Chesapeake Bay. In some sections the scientists and volunteers planted a single species, and in others four or 12 species. Around 8,000 trees planted in the project were monitored yearly for the first three years, and then every two to three years thereafter.Take a 2-minute flyover of BiodiversiTREE, a 20,000-tree forest experiment at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center on Chesapeake Bay. The forest has 16 different tree species, so scientists can tests whether diverse forests are healthier, store more carbon and make better habitat for native animals. Credit: Smithsonian Environmental Research CenterTen years in, the results showed that reforestation projects with diverse species are more likely to include species that thrive at the planting site, lowering the risk of planting failure.\"Even planting four species instead of just one significantly reduced variation in survival in our plots, showing that small increases in diversity could have large impacts on the success of tree planting efforts,\" said Rachel King, forest ecologist at SERC and lead author of the study.The results echo previous tree diversity experiments showing that monocultures can both thrive and utterly fail, making it risky to plant only one species. Single-species plots in BiodiversiTREE were prone to \"boom or bust,\" with species like sycamore seeing 99% survival rates while hickory plots struggled around 21%. However, diverse plots were much more stable. Overall, the variability of survival in single-species plots was roughly double the variability in 4- and 12-species plots.      Forest ecosystems cover almost a third of the land on Earth, supporting most of its terrestrial species and the livelihoods of millions of people around the world. Forests are also critical in the fight against climate change. In the United States alone, there are up to 148 million acres of opportunity to restore forest cover, which could capture 535 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, or the equivalent of removing 116 million cars from the road.\"Tree planting alone will not solve climate change, but done right, has significant potential as a natural climate solution,\" said Susan Cook-Patton, senior forest restoration scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of the paper. \"If we are going to invest in tree planting, it is important to make sure those new forests are set up for success by employing a diverse set of native species.\"                Rachel King, lead author of a new study on forest restoration, prepares to extract a soil core in BiodiversiTREE. Credit: Kristen Goodhue/Smithsonian Environmental Research Center             The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and the third largest in the world, spanning six states and Washington, D.C. But human activities such as overfertilization have imperiled what was once one of the most productive estuaries in the world. Planting trees in this critical watershed will thus help to rehabilitate both the land and waters.\"Forests play important roles by filtering out nutrients, and reforesting a whole watershed\u2014like we did with BiodiversiTREE\u2014can provide valuable insights into improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay,\" said Jamie Pullen, co-author and head technician in the Terrestrial Ecology Lab at SERC.\"Reforestation and tree plantings are an increasing part of natural climate solutions, but few projects monitor their survival outcomes or their impacts on other ecosystem functions,\" said John Parker, senior scientist at SERC and director of BiodiversiTREE. \"BiodiversiTREE and a network of similar projects in the TreeDivNet global consortium seek to fill these knowledge gaps and provide sound science for better ecosystem management.\" More information:Rachel A.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the biosensor that is used to measure the amount of the desired protein?",
    "text": "A unique method to screen large-scale libraries for industrially useful bacterial strains was recently developed by Tokyo Tech researchers. The simple approach combines biosensors and microfluidics to quickly identify mutant strains that secrete large amounts of industrially useful proteins, opening the doors to more applications, like reasonably priced biopharmaceuticals.          With modern genetic engineering tools, it is now possible to modify microorganisms so that their production of industrially useful proteins\u2014such as those used in biopharmaceuticals\u2014is enhanced.By introducing genetic modifications into these organisms, we can use them as biological factories to produce large quantities of the desired protein. Bacteria with this enhanced ability can produce insulin, growth hormones, and enzymes. This approach of increasing microbial secretory protein expression has led to breakthroughs in medicine, industry, and agriculture.Nonetheless, the traditional method of genetically engineering bacterial strains for high protein production is extremely time consuming. This is because it relies on introducing genetic modifications in individual strains and evaluating the effectiveness of protein production.As an alternative, researchers sometimes rely on screening of large-scale libraries for identifying strains which secrete a high amount of protein. This enables the extraction of only those strains that are the best at producing the desired protein. Unfortunately, current screening techniques rely on multiple chemical treatments and are either too slow or too complicated.To overcome these limitations, a team of researchers has now developed a novel, high-throughput mutant strain screening method. The study was led by Associate Professor Tetsuya Kitaguchi from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan, and was conducted in collaboration with Ajinomoto Co., Inc.                The plot shows a comparison of the amount of the desired protein produced between 24 randomly picked strains before sorting and 24 strains picked from the top 50 performers. The best-performing strain produced thrice as much of the desired protein compared to the control strain, showcasing the potential of the proposed approach. Credit: Associate Professor Tetsuya Kitaguchi             The innovative method, which combines microfluidics and versatile biosensing to quickly identify enhanced bacterial strains that produce the highest amount of a desired protein, is reported in their study published in the journal Small.To this end, the researchers first used a type of biosensor called Q-body to measure the amount of the desired protein produced by each strain. Q-bodies are artificial antibodies which become fluorescent on binding to their target. In this case, they were designed to bind to the desired protein, establishing a connection between fluorescence intensity and target protein production.      In addition, the team also devised a clever protocol for sorting the mutant strains based on their performance. Using microfluidic technology, tiny droplets of water containing individual bacteria and Q-bodies were introduced in an oil emulsion, taking advantage of oil and water's mutual immiscibility. These tiny droplets were used as microscopic bacterial cultures and reactors.After 48 hours of incubation, these oil-covered water droplets were encapsulated yet again, in a water emulsion, and sent through a flow cytometer. This device uses a laser and a detector to measure the fluorescence of each individual droplet. Following this, it employs a sorting mechanism to separate droplets with higher fluorescence intensity.The researchers put their method to the test by screening a huge library of bacterial strains created to produce FGF9, a human cytokine, and subjected to circumstances that cause random mutations. Using this method, the team was able to identify a mutant strain that produced three times as much FGF9 compared to the control strain.As Dr. Kitaguchi remarks, \"The entire screening process of 106 mutants was completed in approximately three days, surpassing the throughput of culture evaluation methods that use the latest automated lab instruments.\"Going ahead, the team has high expectations; they hope their proposed method will have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry due to its simplicity, accuracy, and versatility. Dr. Kitaguchi says, \"Applying our screening method for the development of biopharmaceutical proteins may dramatically shorten the time required to establish highly productive industrial microbial strains. We thus believe that this study can contribute to the inexpensive manufacture of various biopharmaceutical proteins.\" More information:Yoshihiro Ito et al, Efficient Microfluidic Screening Method Using a Fluorescent Immunosensor for Recombinant Protein Secretions, Small (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the largest orchid family?",
    "text": "Bulbophyllum is one of the largest genera in the orchid family, with about 2,200 species, and is widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics. In the course of botanical exploration in southeastern Xizang in 2020\u20132022, researchers collected several Bulbophyllum specimens with similar habits and floral characteristics and transplanted them to the orchid conservation center of Tibet Agriculture and Animal Husbandry University.          The researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Tibet Agriculture & Animal Husbandry University conducted a thorough examination of the morphology and further comparative study with the specimens in herbaria, and a survey of the literature.They found that these specimens belong to B. sect. Desmosanthes and could be divided into three entities, one identified as B.stenobulbon, the other identified as B. cauliflorum, but the third was apparently different from these two species and belonged to a previously undescribed species.After careful morphological studies, the researchers confirmed it as a species new to science. They named it as Bulbophyllum basiflorum to refer to the racemes that adhere to the rhizomes of this species. Their study was published in Taiwania.Bulbophyllum basiflorum is morphologically similar to B. cauliflorum and B. stenobulbon, but can be clearly distinguished from them by having shorter scapes attached to rhizomes and pseudobulbs, dense raceme with one or two flowers, petals ovate, lip white with two longitudinal ridges, and very short column foot.Bulbophyllum basiflorum is collected from Dexing and Beibeng village of M\u00eadog, Xizang, China.

    "text": "Carefully planned restoration of agricultural coffee landscapes can increase both farmers' profit and forest cover over a 40-year period, according to a study published May 23rd in the open access journal PLOS Biology by Dr. Sof\u00eda L\u00f3pez-Cubillos at the University of Queensland in Australia, and colleagues.          Restoring patches of natural vegetation in agricultural land presents a trade-off for farmers: while the lost cropland can reduce profitability, increases in ecosystem services like pollination can improve crop yield. To investigate how conservation priorities can be balanced with economic needs, researchers developed a novel planning framework to model the effects of forest restoration on agricultural profits, accounting for the beneficial effect of pollinators. They considered the best spatial arrangement for restoring forests to achieve one of two goals\u2014restoring forest while also expanding agriculture, or restoring forest only\u2014and applied this to a case study of coffee farming in Costa Rica.They divided the study area into a grid of over 60,000 squares and estimated the current coffee yield, bee abundance, and profitability for each square. Calculating coffee profits five years and 40 years into the future under a variety of restoration scenarios, they found that strategically allocating land to agriculture and forest could increase economic returns, compared to a baseline in which the current landscape was maintained. Over a 5-year period, prioritizing restoration was more profitable than strategies that simultaneously expanded agricultural land. After 40 years, strategically balancing conservation and agricultural profits could increase forest cover by 20% while doubling profits for landholders, even when accounting for agricultural land replaced by forest.The study is the first to consider how long-term changes in pollinator abundance can influence the costs and benefits of restoring forest across agricultural landscapes. The results show that with careful planning, pursuing conservation goals can improve economic outcomes for farmers, rather than being a burden, the authors say.L\u00f3pez-Cubillos adds, \"Bee abundance and the pollination services they provide can increase through restoration. This study explored the trade-offs between coffee profitability and forest restoration, finding that within five years profits increased by ~90% after restoration and forest restored area by 20%.\" More information:L\u00f3pez-Cubillos S, McDonald-Madden E, Mayfield MM, Runting RK.

    "question_squad": " What is the most common type of shark bites?",
    "text": "Recent shark bites in Florida and Hawaii and a suspected case in New Jersey have piqued interest in an age-old summer question for beachgoers\u2014is it safe to go in the water?          Scientists and researchers who study sharks said the overwhelming answer to that question is yes, it is safe. Potentially dangerous interactions between humans and sharks are uncommon, and serious injuries and deaths from the bites are vanishingly rare, scientists said.Nonetheless, the dramatic nature of shark bites and the stories of survivors, such as Hawaii surfer Mike Morita's tale of fighting off a shark in April, capture the imagination. It's a good idea to remember just how rare shark bites truly are, scientists said.How often do shark bites occur?There have been typically around 70 to 80 unprovoked shark bites annually, worldwide, over the past decade. And not only are shark bites rare, they've been especially rare recently.There were only 57 unprovoked bites last year, and five of those were fatal, according to University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. There had been nine such deaths the previous year.The shark attack file reported a year ago that one reason for the decline in bites might be be the global decline of shark populations.It's too early in the warm season to get an idea of how active this year will be for interactions between humans and sharks, said Greg Skomal, a shark expert with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.\"If we get lots of bait fish and forage fish species close to shore, we have a super hot summer that draws people to beaches, more people in the water, then we can determine the risk,\" Skomal said.                In this May, 22, 2019, file photo, a woman walks with her dogs at Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, Mass., where a boogie boarder was bitten by a shark in 2018 and later died of his injuries. Recent shark bites in Florida and Hawaii and a suspected case in New Jersey have peaked interest in the age-old summer question of whether it's safe to go in the water. Credit: AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File             What are the most prone areas for shark encounters?The United States and Australia are typically the sites of the most reported shark bites. Florida had more bites than anywhere else on Earth last year with 16 unprovoked bites, two of which resulted in amputations, the shark attack file said.This month, two Florida fishermen were bitten by sharks in separate incidents less than 36 hours apart.The rate of shark bites has stayed steady in recent years, but it might feel like a more common occurrence because of the prevalence of smartphones, said Nick Whitney, a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium in Boston. Recently developed smartphone apps allow users to report shark sightings in real time.      What kind of sharks are cause for concern?White sharks, bull sharks and tiger sharks are the sharks most cited by the International Shark Attack File for unprovoked bites. Those species are large sharks that also cause the most fatalities.However, it's worth bearing in mind that many interactions with sharks are with smaller species that are unlikely to cause serious injuries, said James Sulikowski, director of the Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station at Oregon State University. Those species might bite a human, realize we are not their preferred prey and move on, he said.Is it safe to swim?Yes. You're at exponentially greater risk of getting hurt in a car accident on the way to the beach than you are to get seriously injured by a shark bite.Millions of people flock to the beach in the summer as the weather heats up, and that raises the possibility of interacting with a shark. But by taking simple precautions, such as not carrying shiny objects into the water and not swimming at dawn and dusk, beachgoers can reduce any chance of a dangerous encounter with a shark, Sulikowski said.\"We are intruders in their environment. What we can do is be logical and safe about that and avoid areas where sharks are going to be feeding,\" Sulikowski said. \"When an interaction occurs, it's mistaken identity\u2014we are in an area where a shark is looking to eat.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

    "text": "In nature, flowers may share morphological features, even across distantly related species. Bilateral symmetry is one such feature found in flowers of various taxa, such as orchids and legumes. Animals enter these bilaterally symmetrical flowers from the front with their ventral side down. This observation has led to the belief that bilateral floral symmetry represents an adaptation to allow the stamens and pistils to touch specific areas of an animal's body, thereby increasing pollination accuracy. However, this notion, widely held since the 18th century, has been recently refuted.       The new study, published in The Science of Nature, noted that more than 90% of bilaterally symmetrical flowers, such as orchids, are presented horizontally. Accordingly, animals naturally approach these flowers from the front with their ventral side down. This indicates that the observed stabilization of animal flower entry may not be attributed to bilateral symmetry but to the accompanied horizontal orientation.The researchers conducted indoor experiments using nine different artificial flowers with exhaustive combinations of floral symmetry (bilateral symmetry, disymmetry, and radial symmetry) and orientation (upward, horizontal, and downward) to investigate the effects of floral symmetry and orientation on the stability of flower entry by bumble bees, Bombus ignitus.As expected, the results of this study showed that the entry angle of bees was significantly stabilized when flowers were presented horizontally, with a 60% reduction in angular variation compared to the upward and downward orientations. Meanwhile, none of the three types of floral symmetry were found to contribute to the stabilization of flower entry. This remarkable result prompts a reconsideration of the adaptive significance of bilaterally symmetrical flowers that have evolved repeatedly in angiosperms.

    "question_squad": " What is a survival strategy for many organisms?",
    "text": "Dormancy is a survival strategy for many organisms that involves suppressing development and reproduction for a period of time to reduce energy consumption in unfavorable environments. In some insects, reproductive dormancy occurs during seasons unsuitable for reproduction due to a decrease in the amount of juvenile hormone, which is a well-known insect hormone.       Although neurons projecting from the brain to the juvenile hormone-producing organ (corpus allatum) have been known to regulate reproductive dormancy for >50 years, the specific neurosecretory factors controlling the amount of juvenile hormone have remained unclear.Researchers used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to demonstrate for the first time that the neuropeptide diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) regulates reproductive dormancy. They discovered that neurons projecting from the brain to the corpus allatum produce DH31 and that DH31 secreted by these neurons is crucial for reproductive dormancy. Additionally, they found that DH31 receptors are expressed in the corpus allatum and that receiving DH31 suppresses juvenile hormone production, inducing reproductive dormancy. The work is published in the journal Development.Given the evidence that neurons projecting to the corpus allatum regulate reproductive dormancy in various insects and that DH31 is conserved, it is likely that DH31 controls reproductive dormancy in a broad range of insect species. Understanding the mechanisms of insect dormancy control could lead to the development of new technologies to control agricultural pests and infectious disease vectors.

    "text": "Researchers from the Institute of Applied Ecology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Nanjing University have found that nitrogen (N) addition and experimental drought reduced the complexity of arthropod networks.          The study published in Functional Ecology.Biodiversity is under threat from global change. Efforts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the influence of global change focus mainly on species diversity, but neglect the network of their interactions, which is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Moreover, multiple drivers of global change are typically studied separately, rather than in concert, which is more realistic in nature.In this study, the researchers conducted a two-year field experiment at the Erguna Forest-Steppe Ecotone Research Station in northern China. They examined the relationship between the complexity and stability of arthropod networks with plant communities and microhabitats to elucidate the drivers of the changes in arthropod networks in grasslands under nitrogen addition, drought and delayed snowmelt.According to the researchers, the effects of nitrogen addition and drought on the arthropod networks are different. Nitrogen addition decreased arthropod network complexity because increased foliar N and simplified plant communities strengthened trophic chains along a single pathway, weakening the net effect of other pathways. Experimental drought reduced network complexity by filtering out plant species and altering microhabitats.They also found that delayed snowmelt significantly increased arthropod abundance only in early spring, and showed mixed effects on arthropod diversity and abundance when combined with simulated nitrogen deposition and/or summer drought.These results highlight the need to study multiple global change drivers together, even if they occur in different seasons, to most realistically simulate their effects.

Published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, their study highlights the \"radical transparency\" enabled by unmanned airborne vehicles and terrestrial sensors capable of amassing data down to the level of a square meter.\"We estimate that within the next five to 10 years, the environmental footprint of every farmer, forester and horticulturalist in the country may become publicly available,\" Dr. Reid says. \"The emphasis of our paper is on what this means for assurance purposes, for management, and for how these entities operate.\"While Dr. Reid and Professor Castka acknowledge the sensitivities accompanying this level of transparency, they believe it can also deliver significant benefits.\"Compliance standards create a heavy load for farmers,\" Professor Castka says. \"Remote sensing automates this, so it isn't taking them away from what they want to be doing.\"In addition to efficiency gains, Dr. Reid highlights how land managers could receive timely data regarding their productivity and environmental impacts. \"It will also allow land managers who are truly regenerative to stand out, becoming examples that others can learn from.\" He says the response from industry has in most cases been positive and adds that the leaders in this space will gain a powerful marketing tool, for use both here and internationally, for sustainable products.Dr. Reid is also co-lead of Eco-index, a research program hosted at the University of Waikato, that measures biodiversity health and investment in Aotearoa. He says substantial private investment in environmental sensing is happening internationally, and that particular interest has been shown in the environmental insights and wisdom traditions held by M\u0101ori.The researchers recognize the privacy concerns accompanying the evolution of this technology, however they hope the increased transparency will encourage more aspirational goals for Aotearoa's biodiversity.\"It's not enough to preserve what we have now for the next generation,\" Professor Castka says, \"It's about making it better.\" More information:John Reid et al, The impact of remote sensing on monitoring and reporting\u2014The case of conformance systems, Journal of Cleaner Production (2023).

    "text": "Morpho butterflies are emblematic species of the Amazonian rainforest known for their metallic shades of blue and green. Despite their conspicuous looks and fascinating biology, large-scale genome sequencing efforts have somewhat neglected them\u2014until now.          In a new article published in the open-access journal GigaScience, H\u00e9lo\u00efse Bastide and coworkers at IDEEV in Gif-sur-Yvette and at the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris present the first full-length genome sequences for three species of Morpho butterflies: The common blue morpho (M. helenor), the Achilles morpho (M. achilles), and the Deidamia morpho (M. deidamia). The data here provide an opportunity to investigate how two butterflies exist in the same region and look similar, yet remain separate species.These three Morpho species co-occur in the same habitat\u2014that is, they live in \"sympatry,\" as evolutionary biologists call it. Previous studies have also shown that Morpho males are attracted to the wing patterns of other similar species besides their own. For our understanding of the process of speciation, this raises a question that has fascinated evolutionary biologists for a long time: If closely related species live in the same habitat, and individuals of different species are sexually attracted to each other, what is the reproductive barrier that keeps them distinct and prevents the separate species from blending back into one?Part of the answer may lie in the butterflies' behavior. If the species are active at different times of the day, they are less likely to encounter specimens of their sister species, thus maintaining reproductive isolation.Other answers to the question of how sympatric Morpho species can become and remain distinct may be found in their genomes. The authors of the new GigaScience study compared the genomes of the three Morpho species and found that their genetic makeup is very similar overall. There is, however, one notable exception on the so-called Z chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes in butterflies), where multiple large-scale rearrangements of genomic material have been detected, and now, thanks to this new high-quality genome sequences, these rearrangements can be characterized in great detail.For sex determination in butterflies, the females have a WZ sex-chromosome constitution while males are ZZ. Due to the genomic inversions, genetic incompatibilities arise between sister species, which keep the species' identities separate\u2014even if they live in the same habitat.Overall, the new high-quality assembly and annotation of these three species of Morpho butterflies reveal differences in chromosome numbers, the presence of several long inversions in the Z chromosome, and genetic divergence among copies of genes that may play a significant role in reproductive isolation. Similar mechanisms have been described previously in other butterfly species, but this new work brings the emblematic Morpho butterflies into play as one of the organisms where fundamental questions of evolution can be studied at a detailed genomic level, and provide far greater understanding of the processes of speciation.The mechanisms underlying the development and sustainment of new species may provide more information on how to maintain biological diversity. As the authors point out in conclusion, \"the study opens new avenues into the investigation of the ecological and genomic factors involved in sympatric speciation and its reinforcement.\" More information:H\u00e9lo\u00efse Bastide et al, Genome assembly of 3 Amazonian Morpho butterfly species reveals Z-chromosome rearrangements between closely related species living in sympatry, GigaScience (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the foundation of our food systems?",
    "text": "Nurturing a forest ecosystem back to life after it's been logged is not always easy.          It can take a lot of hard work and careful monitoring to ensure biodiversity thrives again. But monitoring biodiversity can be costly, intrusive and resource-intensive. That's where ecological acoustic survey methods, or \"ecoacoustics,\" come into play.Indeed, the planet sings. Think of birds calling, bats echolocating, tree leaves fluttering in the breeze, frogs croaking and bush crickets stridulating. We live in a euphonious theater of life.Even the creatures in the soil beneath our feet emit unique vibrations as they navigate through the earth to commute, hunt, feed and mate.Eavesdropping on this subterranean cacophony using special microphones can provide researchers with important insights into ecosystem health. Our new study published in Restoration Ecology shows ecoacoustics can provide an effective way of monitoring biodiversity in soil and in the forest it supports.What did the study do?Acoustic technology is widely used to survey bats, birds and other creatures. However, scientists who restore degraded ecosystems have yet to make full use of soil ecoacoustics. This is despite its demonstrable effectiveness at detecting small animal vibrations.Our study applied ecoacoustic tools to measure biodiversity above and below ground in a UK forest. We hypothesized that the soils of forests restored to a healthier state would have a higher diversity of sounds than the soils of recently deforested plots. This is because we assumed more creatures would live in the restored and \"healthier\" soils, producing a greater variety of sounds that we would detect.Think of two symphony orchestras. Half of one orchestra's musicians have fallen ill and can't play at the concert. This is analogous to a degraded ecosystem. In contrast, the other orchestra has all its members and will therefore be louder, with more complex and diverse sounds.During the spring and summer of 2022, we collected 378 samples from three recently deforested and three restored forest plots. We created a recording system with special \"contact\" microphones that we inserted into the ground.We used a chamber with sound-dampening foam inside to record soil creatures such as earthworms and beetles. This chamber allowed us to block out unwanted signals such as mechanical noise, wind and human activity. The chamber housed the microphone and a 5 liter sample of the soil at each plot.                Birds, including Australian magpies, are known to listen for worms. Scientists can also use the sounds of the soil to assess its health. Credit: Shutterstock             Our results were exciting. The diversity of sounds was much higher in the soil from the restored plots. This finding confirmed our suspicions that healthier soil would be more tuneful.      Why is monitoring soil health important?Our preliminary findings suggest ecoacoustics can monitor life underground. But why is monitoring soil biodiversity so important? Soil health is the foundation of our food systems and supports all other life on land. It should be a global priority.The \"unseen\" and \"unheard\" organisms living in the soil maintain its health. Below-ground organisms, such as earthworms and beetles, play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil health. Without them, forests can't thrive.By using ecoacoustics to monitor below-ground biodiversity, ecologists can better assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts. This will allow them to make more informed decisions about the best ways to protect nature.Using ecoacoustics in restoration efforts could also have important implications for climate change mitigation. Forests are crucial carbon sinks. They absorb CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and store it in their woody biomass and soils.In contrast, degraded or deforested areas are significant sources of carbon emissions. Restoring these areas and monitoring subterranean life can help reduce carbon emissions and improve our ability to reduce the effects of a changing climate.It's still an emerging scienceThe use of ecoacoustics in restoration efforts is still relatively new, but it's an important step towards a more holistic and effective approach to ecosystem recovery. By embracing new technologies and approaches, we can work towards a healthier and more sustainable planet.Of course, there are challenges we still have to overcome. For instance, accurately identifying the sources of acoustic signals in a complex soundscape can be challenging. However, as technologies and methods continue to improve, the potential benefits of ecoacoustics are immense.By monitoring life underground in a non-intrusive and efficient way, we can better understand the effectiveness of our restoration efforts. This will help us make more informed decisions about how to protect nature.We've only just begun to scratch the surface when it comes to the possibilities of ecoacoustics in restoration efforts. It's an exciting time for those working in this field, as we discover new ways to use sound to heal our planet.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the mechanism that enables plants to provide protection against salt stress for their sensitive stem cells?",
    "text": "A team of researchers, including Prof J\u00f6rg Kudla from the Institute of the Biology and Biotechnology of Plants at M\u00fcnster University, has found a mechanism in thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) that enables plants to provide protection against salt stress for their sensitive stem cells in the meristem at the root tip.          A high content of sodium-containing salts in the soil is a problem for many plants: as a result, they grow less well, or not at all. Soil salinization is seen as one of the greatest threats to feeding the world's population because it makes soils increasingly infertile, especially in dry regions.A team of Chinese, German and Spanish researchers, including Prof J\u00f6rg Kudla and his team from the University of M\u00fcnster, has now found a mechanism in thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) that enables plants to provide protection against salt stress for their sensitive stem cells in the meristem at the root tip. The meristem, which ensures that the root constantly forms new cells and thus can grow, is particularly sensitive\u2014in contrast to fully formed plant cells, its cells have no vacuole inside where harmful substances can be disposed of.The discovery that plants can provide protection against toxic salt stress specifically for individual groups of cells came as something of a surprise to the researchers. Although it was already known that there are various mechanisms in plants that enable them to cope with high salt contents in soil water\u2014one is an active transportation of salt out of the cells, another is the mechanical impregnation of a specific cell layer in the root\u2014what was not known was that plants also specifically protect the stem cells in their roots.\"The signaling pathway we have discovered\u2014which combines components of known salt-stress signaling pathways with signaling proteins for the purpose of controlling root development\u2014serves the additional purpose of specifically detoxifying the plant,\" says J\u00f6rg Kudla.The mechanism includes a special enzyme\u2014a receptor-like kinase called GSO1\u2014that transports the sodium out of the cells of the meristem. To this end, GSO1 activates the kinase SOS2 (SOS stands for \"salt overly sensitive\"), and this in turn activates a transport protein (SOS1) that pumps sodium ions outward, via the cell membrane, and, in return, transports protons into the cell. In the case of salt stress, there is an increased formation of GSO1 especially in the meristem cells.In addition, the team demonstrated that GSO1 also helps to prevent too much salt from penetrating into the vascular tissue of the root. This vascular tissue is located in the interior of the plant and transports water and minerals from the roots into the leaves. A mechanical barrier, the Casparian strip, is protected from minerals dissolved in the soil water penetrating into it in an uncontrolled fashion. The researchers also demonstrated a higher GSO1 content in the cells forming the Casparian strip increases due to salt stress.\"GSO1 is a receptor kinase well known in plant developmental biology,\" says J\u00f6rg Kudla. \"It plays an important role in various stages in a plant's development. Now, for the first time, we were able to demonstrate that it also plays a role in salt tolerance and activates the 'sodium-out pump' via an alternative signaling pathway which is presumably not dependent on calcium.\" Calcium signals in the cells play a key role in other known adaptive responses of plants to salt stress.The team discovered the significance of GSO1 by comparing numerous mutants of various receptor-like kinases in the thale cress. By studying protein interactions, they identified the reaction partners of the enzyme within the signaling pathways for protecting the meristem and forming the Casparian strip. Methods used in further investigations included mass spectrometry and high-resolution microscopy. The findings are published in The EMBO Journal.

    "question_squad": " What is the most important aspect of having adequate bee populations?",
    "text": "While Texas bee populations have declined due to drought and other harsh weather conditions over recent years, they seem to be in good shape for a late spring and early summer recovery, according to Texas A&M AgriLife entomologists.          \"There was a 14% drop in honey production in 2021, and while there's no data about 2022 as yet, one can assume production was affected for a couple of reasons,\" said Molly Keck, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service entomologist for Bexar County. \"The two main reasons were that there was not enough forage in some areas of the state due to drought as well as the fact that honeybees don't go out and forage when temperatures are too high.\"Keck said lack of foraging and nectar-producing resources means less food brought back into the hive to be turned into honey.\"Areas where there are abundant nectar and pollen sources, along with other good conditions, are where honeybees will do best,\" she said.Keck said while honey production is important, the most vital aspect of having adequate bee populations is their role as pollinators, particularly for agricultural crops.Bees have taken a beatingTexas Beekeepers Association president Dodie Stillman said Texas beekeepers were faced with \"Snowmageddon,\" a term applied to Winter Storm Uri in early 2021, which brought freezing temperatures, ice and snow for about three weeks.The Bee Informed Partnership's colony loss report showed Texas had an annual loss of 33.9% in honeybee population from April 2021 to April 2022. And Texas beekeeper quarterly data for April to June 2022 showed honeybee colony losses much higher than the acceptable loss of 13% to 17%. Additionally, a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on honeybee colonies nationwide found that from April to June of 2022, 45.2% of colonies were affected by varroa mites.\"Small-scale beekeepers lost a significant number of bees during the past few years, and it has taken a while for them to come back,\" Stillman said. \"Small-scale beekeepers are mostly stationary, so if the local weather is harsh or doesn't allow for the production of nectar-bearing flowers, bees will produce less honey.\"Fortunately, Stillman said, beekeepers in Texas and elsewhere regularly split their bee colonies to create more of them, which has helped in the overall recovery.Dr. Juliana Rangel, Texas A&M AgriLife Research honeybee scientist in the Department of Entomology, said the extended winter snows in 2021 were followed by extensive drought throughout the state last year, further exacerbating losses.\"Even earlier this year, we had some strange winter-spring weather that was unusually wet, which kept many colonies in this part of our state inactive or unable to forage,\" Rangel said.      Reason to bee optimisticStillman said while beekeepers are always worried about the weather, things are already looking positive for 2023.\"If the bee populations get sufficient rain at the right times\u2014and not too much to make the nectar fall out of flowers\u2014they should be in much better shape this year than in previous years,\" she said.Rangel said it's very possible that by late spring or early summer there could be a significant increase in bee populations and activity\u2014if milder weather prevails.\"We are already seeing a proliferation of the types of wildflowers bees prefer for gathering their nectar,\" she said.Some of the wildflowers bees prefer include horse mint, Indian paintbrush and almond verbena.Rangel also said the number of bee colonies in the U.S. has been edging upward by about 1% annually, and that trend applies to Texas colonies as well.\"If you combine that increase with the amount of floriation and good local weather patterns, we may get a good flow and see a spike in nectar production in late spring and summer,\" she said.About honey productionRangel said Texas typically ranks sixth among states for honey production\u2014after North and South Dakota, California, Florida and Minnesota.The recent rains have brought a massive floriation that has the potential to greatly boost bee populations and honey production later this spring and early summer.\"Bee populations in Central Texas are growing, and some bees are already in 'honey flow,' which means they are bringing back enough nectar to store and feed to their young,\" Stillman said.Dr. Steven Klose, professor and AgriLife Extension economist in Texas A&M's Department of Agricultural Economics, said a challenge for small-scale beekeepers is the business of competing in a market where honey is produced on a large scale and readily available.\"Similar to other commodity product markets, small-scale honey producers may struggle to compete from a cost-efficiency standpoint,\" Klose said. \"Therefore, they need to find a way to differentiate their product to attract a premium price. Niche market opportunities may come from simply being 'locally sourced' or being produced from a unique nectar source.\"Bees in agricultureAlong with their role in honey production, bees are responsible for pollinating 75% of the world's flowering plants and 35% of the world's crops. In particular, honeybees are the most common pollinator and an important bee to domestic agriculture.It is estimated that the honeybee's annual contribution to the U.S. economy is at least $15 billion. More than 90 different crops\u2014about one-third of total crop production in the U.S.\u2014depend on bees for their survival.Bees also pollinate crops that feed cattle, such as clover and alfalfa, making them very important to both the beef cattle and dairy industries.\"Texas is one of the preferred states for many commercial pollinators who hold bees here in winter and then take them to other states for pollination services as early as February and throughout the year,\" Rangel said.

    "question_squad": " What did the mice eat after the seeds were planted?",
    "text": "A team of life and environmental scientists from The University of Sydney has found that spraying wheat fields with wheat germ oil after seeding deters mice that feed on seeds. In their study, reported in journal Nature Sustainability, the group tested a technique first used in New Zealand to protect endangered birds.          Farmers have been attempting to outmaneuver field mice for centuries\u2014mice like to eat grains, whether stored or in the ground in the form of seeds. Prior research has found that they consume approximately 70 million tons of maize, rice and wheat grains each year around the globe. Unfortunately, despite massive efforts to deter the rodents, farmers still must rely on poisons, and in some cases, cats. In this new effort, the researchers may have found a better option.The researchers noted that colleagues in New Zealand had tried smearing the scents of endangered birds over areas where the birds would never visit. This led to predators growing suspicious of such scents, because when followed, there was no payoff. That led them to ignore the smell of the birds even when they were present.To see if the approach might work with mice, the team treated 60 10x10 plots with wheat germ oil, which contains the scent of the wheat germ\u2014the part of the wheat the mice want to eat. To gauge its effectiveness, the team sprayed it on plots before planting seeds and others after seeding. They also left a few plots untreated.A mouse digging at a patch treated with wheat germ oil. Credit: Peter BanksThey were surprised to find that the oil did not serve as a false signal; the mice still ate the seeds where the plots had been pretreated. But they also found that the mice largely left alone the plots where treatment had occurred after planting. This, the researchers suggest, was likely because an overabundance of aroma had confused the mice, making it nearly impossible for them to find the seeds. More information:Finn C. G.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the weed that is currently invading superblooms across the Southwestern U.S.?",
    "text": "Though prescribed burns reduce wildfire threats and even improve habitat for some animals, new research shows these fires also spread stinknet, an aptly named weed currently invading superblooms across the Southwestern U.S.          Stinknet, also called globe chamomile, is native to South Africa, but is commonly seen in photos of California's colorful superblooms. \"Not all flowering plants are indicative of a healthy ecosystem,\" said Loralee Larios, UC Riverside assistant botany professor and study co-author. \"This one isn't.\"In addition to its unpleasant odor, each of its tiny yellow ball-shaped flowers can hold hundreds of seeds. While expanding across entire parks, it crowds out native plants on which endangered local animals rely.The invader also reduces the overall health of the soil. In some cases, if an invasive plant changes the composition of the landscape enough, the soil can release stored carbon into the atmosphere, accelerating the negative effects of climate change.For these reasons, the researchers looked more closely at how stinknet spreads. They found that after a prescribed burn, many unburned patches of stinknet remain in what is otherwise bare ground, free of competition from other plants. \"In fact, patches of stinknet left over after a burn create focal points for more invasions,\" Larios said.This finding is detailed in the journal Restoration Ecology. To obtain it, the researchers observed plant behavior on a burned plot of land in Southern California's Lake Perris State Park. Over two years, starting in 2020, they saw that the unburned stinknet patches had double the number of viable seeds, as compared to the areas that were completely burned and had no leftover stinknet.It appears that singed patches create favorable microclimates for stinknet, creating soil temperature, light, and moisture conditions that help it spread.                Stinknet and human fingers, for scale. Credit: iNaturalist             Additionally, they found that adding native plant seeds back into the burned area did not significantly increase the presence of native species. \"Stinknet likely releases chemicals through its roots that kill soil fungi essential for native plant growth,\" said Stuart Schwab, a doctoral candidate in plant sciences at UCR and lead study author.      Because prescribed burns offer so many benefits for the landscape, including removing highly flammable invasive grasses, the researchers are not suggesting that land managers end the practice. Rather, they are calling for more targeted, secondary stinknet treatments after burns.\"Options could include pulling patches of remaining stinknet out of the ground by hand, or doing something called solarizing, where you put a dark tarp on an area to heat and kill any remaining seeds underneath,\" Schwab said. \"As a last resort they could use herbicides.\"Going forward, the research team would like to conduct similar studies to understand how fire impacts the spread of other invasive species.In the meantime, hikers and nature lovers can do a lot to help stop stinknet spread. \"Clean your boots if you go on hikes.

    "text": "A wind farm in northeastern Brazil sounds like a welcome climate-friendly energy solution, but it is causing controversy over another kind of environmental worry: the impact on the endangered Lear's macaw.          Home to more than 90 percent of Brazil's booming wind-power industry, the northeast is known for strong, steady winds that President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants to harness to power a green-energy revolution.The region has drawn the interest of French renewable energy company Voltalia, which broke ground last year on a 28-turbine, 100-megawatt wind farm in semi-arid Canudos county, in the state of Bahia.But the project soon came under attack when it emerged that the enormous turbines, with their 120-meter (nearly 400-foot) diameter blades\u2014a known threat to birds in flight\u2014were being built in a nesting region for the Lear's macaw, a bright blue parrot also known as the indigo macaw, or by its scientific name Anodorhynchus leari.Named for 19th-century English poet Edward Lear, the birds have dwindled to an estimated population of no more than 2,000 in the wild, as farming and logging have vastly reduced their habitat.The wind farm is \"very risky,\" said Marlene Reis, of the Lear's Macaw Gardens Project, an organization trying to save the species.                The Canudos Wind Energy Complex is one of many wind projects in Brazil's northeast, where energy and conservation demands can be at odds.             \"It could considerably increase the risk of extinction,\" she told AFP.And the damage \"could be irreversible, especially for these iconic macaws, who only live and reproduce in this region.\"A federal court halted the final stage of construction on the turbines in April, revoking Voltalia's permits.\"It cannot be considered a low environmental impact\" project, given the proximity to an endangered bird species, the court ruled, ordering further impact studies and consultations with local communities.Voltalia has appealed the decision.\"The potential environmental and social impacts have already been dealt with exhaustively,\" Voltalia's country manager for Brazil, Nicolas Thouverez, told AFP.The impact studies required by state authorities have shown the turbines \"in no way endanger the conservation\" of the Lear's macaw, he said.                A Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) was electrocuted after flying into a power grid close to Brazil's Canudos Wind Energy Complex.             \"They demonstrated the environmental viability of the project.\"The company has proposed reducing risks by painting the turbines to make them more visible to birds, as well as fitting the macaws with GPS trackers and installing technology that immediately stops the blades turning when they fly over.      'The name of progress'Brazil is a world leader on green energy.It has the largest percentage of clean electricity in the G20 group of nations, at 89 percent.Lula, who took office in January, has vowed to expand that further still.Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said recently that Lula wants to turn Brazil's impoverished northeast into the \"biggest renewable energy breadbasket in the world.\"Silveira has announced plans to install up to 30 gigawatts of clean energy production capacity in the northeast, mainly wind and solar.                    A truck transports parts of a wind turbine on the way to the Canudos Wind Energy Complex in Canudos, Bahia state, Brazil, on May 6, 2023.                                     Brazilian goat farmer Adelson Matos says the building of a wind farm nearby has drawn vehicle traffic at all hours, and has altered rain and wind patterns with its enormous structures.                 The total investment could reach 120 billion reais ($24 billion).But Voltalia offers a case study of the kind of opposition projects can run into on the ground.In addition to the outcry over the Lear's macaw, the company faces resistance from small-scale communal farmers and cattle ranchers, around 7,500 of whom live in the area around the wind farm.\"The impact will be felt across the board,\" said Adelson Matos, 65, a white-bearded farmer who tends to goats, sheep, cows, chickens and fruit in the nearby village of Alto Redondo.The wind farm is noisy, draws vehicle traffic at all hours, and has altered rain and wind patterns with its enormous structures, Matos complained.\"It breaks all harmony with the natural habitat,\" he told AFP.\"All in the name of progress,\" he said bitterly.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Brazil faces dilemma: endangered macaw vs. wind farm (2023, May 23)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-brazil-dilemma-endangered-macaw-farm.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "The ordinary person looks at Stone Mountain and sees a solid, unmovable monolith. Emory paleontologist Anthony Martin, who thinks in geologic time, sees something more akin to a giant sugar cube.          Ever since the crystalized mass of igneous-born minerals rose from deep underground, pushed by the upwelling of magma that formed the Blue Ridge Mountains around 350 million years ago, the giant rock's flanks have faced continuous assault\u2014and not just from weather and water.Stone Mountain \"is fighting a battle against life, and life is winning,\" Martin writes in the preface of his new book, \"Life Sculpted: Tales of the Animals, Plants and Fungi That Drill, Break and Scrape to Shape the Earth.\"The University of Chicago Press is publishing \"Life Sculpted\" June 2, marking the fifth book during the past 10 years by Martin, professor of practice in Emory's Department of Environmental Sciences.Martin is a geologist and paleontologist focused primarily on ichnology\u2014the study of traces of life such as tracks, burrows, nests and tooth marks. Among his discoveries are the only known burrowing dinosaur and the oldest bird tracks in Australia. His other passion is great science communication, which his books exemplify.\"Life Sculpted\" is a follow-up to Martin's 2017 book \"The Evolution Underground: Burrows, Bunkers and the Marvelous Subterranean World Beneath Our Feet.\" The current volume, also aimed at anyone interested in Earth sciences, goes beyond burrowing to cover how myriad forms of life have broken down the hard substrates of rock, shells, bones and wood during the past billion years.\"Yes, life can be hard,\" Martin quips, \"but life also makes everything less hard every day. Bioerosion shapes the world, literally. It's changed entire ecosystems.\"Bioerosion has also changed human history. Martin cites the wood-boring clams that perforated the hulls of the Spanish Armada, helping tip the odds toward the English Navy in 1588, when it won a decades-long fight for maritime dominance.Bioeroders come in all sizes, he writes, from microbes that transport calcium away from rock and shells to elephants that dig caves with their tusks to obtain salt.      Bioeroders can change the soundscape as well as the landscape.In a chapter titled \"Your Beach Is Made of Parrotfish Poop,\" Martin describes hearing \"a crunching and popping reminiscent of sugary breakfast cereals meeting milk\" while snorkeling over a Bahamian reef.The crunching, he explains, is actually the sound of parrotfishes biting out chunks of the reef with jaws and teeth capable of breaking apart rock. Reefs and the surrounding shallow-marine environments have been shaped by millions of years of such fishes gnawing on coral and defecating sediments.Martin doesn't just want readers to visualize and hear bioerosion. He also wants them to smell it.He describes how dinosaurs chewed up rotten wood to get at insects and how insects, in turn, bored into the limb bones of large Jurassic dinosaurs that apparently became trapped in a stinking mud pit of decomposing flesh in Colorado.The book gives many modern-day examples of bioeroders closer to home. Georgia \"hosts small, furry, bone-destroying beings that descend from the trees and eat skulls,\" Martin writes. He knows this from personal observation of gray squirrels that relentlessly gnawed to bits a cow skull he and his wife had hanging in their courtyard.\"It's their calcium supplement,\" he explains.And then there are all the bioeroders who have been busily at work on Stone Mountain.Lichens colonized the enormous rock's surface as soon as it emerged into the air, starting the process of soil formation that then allowed plants to take root. Animals began scurrying across and digging into its crumbling surface. Those animals eventually included humans, among the leading biological excavators of hard materials on the planet.Humans have chiseled massive chunks from Stone Mountain's side and removed tons of granite from its core. And any time you hike up Stone Mountain, Martin wants you to consider that you are taking a bit of its powdery dust with you on your footwear when you leave.\"The book is filled with 'aha' moments for the reader,\" Martin says. \"I want to encourage people to look for the evidence and to expand their awareness of how life is shaping the Earth.\" Provided byEmory UniversityCitation:New book eyes Earth's excavators, from microbes to elephants and dinosaurs (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-eyes-earth-excavators-microbes-elephants.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "Fertilized chicken eggs can be sexed by \"sniffing\" volatile chemicals emitted through the shell, according to new work by researchers at the University of California, Davis, and Sensit Ventures Inc., a startup company in Davis. The work is published May 22 in PLOS ONE.          The study shows that it is feasible to sort eggs by sex, early in incubation, based on volatile organic chemicals, said Professor Cristina Davis, associate vice chancellor for interdisciplinary research and strategic initiatives at UC Davis and co-author on the paper.Hatcheries for laying hens sort chicks by sex a day after hatching, with male chicks being culled immediately. If hatcheries could instead identify the sex of an egg early in incubation, billions of male eggs could be humanely diverted to other uses, reducing waste and environmental impact. Some European countries have already banned culling of male chicks or plan to phase it out.Technology already on the market depends either on sampling the egg through a tiny hole in the shell, or imaging through the shell. Imaging technology is more accurate with older eggs.The UC Davis/Sensit approach relies on detecting volatile organic compounds given off by the developing embryo that diffuse through the shell. The first step was to find out if there is a reliably detectable difference in the chemicals given off by male and female embryos.Davis's lab at the UC Davis Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has developed sensing chip technology that can be used to collect and analyze organic chemicals in the air. The patented technology has been licensed by Sensit, which aims to commercialize it for a range of applications including agriculture and medicine.Suction cup snifferThe researchers adapted suction cups used for industrial handling of eggs to \"sniff\" air from the eggs without opening them. The air samples were analyzed in Davis's lab with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The sex of the eggs was confirmed by DNA analysis in Professor Huajin Zhou's lab at the UC Davis Department of Animal Science.\"We found that there are volatile chemicals from the egg, a scent that you can capture and sort statistically,\" said Tom Turpen, president and CEO of Sensit Ventures and senior author on the paper. Using this method, the researchers were able to identify male and female embryos at 8 days of incubation with 80% accuracy, based on two minutes of sampling.Rapid suction-cup sampling could be carried out in rows to test a lot of eggs at the same time.\"We think that the hardware platform invented at UC Davis could be integrated into hatcheries,\" Turpen said.Additional authors on the paper are: at UC Davis, Eva Borras, Ying Wang, Kevin Bellido, Katherine Hamera, Mitchell McCartney and Kristy Portillo; Priyanka Shah and Robert Arlen, Sensit Ventures.

    "text": "In modern society, one parent may take a daughter to ballet class and fix dinner so the other parent can get to exercise class before picking up the son from soccer practice. To an observer, they seem to be cooperating in their very busy, co-parenting, monogamous relationship.          These people may think they are part of an evolved society different from the other mammals that inhabit earth. But their day-to-day behavior and child-rearing habits are not much different than other mammals who hunt, forage for food, and rear and teach their children, researchers suggest.\"For a long time it has been argued that humans are an exceptional, egalitarian species compared to other mammals,\" said Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, professor emerita of anthropology at the University of California, Davis, and corresponding author of a new study. But, she said, this exceptionalism may have been exaggerated.\"Humans appear to resemble mammals that live in monogamous partnerships and to some extent, those classified as cooperative breeders, where breeding individuals have to rely on the help of others to raise their offspring,\" she said.The UC Davis-led study, with more than 100 researchers collaborating from several institutions throughout the world, is the first to look at whether human males are more egalitarian than are males among other mammals, focusing on the numbers of offspring they produce.The article, \"Reproductive inequality in humans and other mammals,\" was published this week (May 22) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Co-authors include researchers from UC Davis, The Santa Fe Institute, the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany.The researchers amassed data from 90 human populations comprising 80,223 individuals from many parts of the world\u2014both historical and contemporary. They compared the records for men and women to lifetime data for 45 different nonhuman, free-ranging mammals.The researchers found that humans are by no means exceptional, merely another unique species of mammal. Furthermore, as first author Cody Ross, former UC Davis graduate student in the Department of Anthropology now at the Max Planck Institute, points out \"we can quite successfully model reproductive inequality in humans and nonhumans using the same predictors.\"Egalitarianism in polygynous societiesSomewhat unexpectedly, when focusing specifically on women, the researchers found greater reproductive egalitarianism in societies that allow for polygynous marriage than in those where monogamous marriage prevails. In polygynous systems, in which men take several wives at the same time, women tend to have more equal access to resources, such as land, food and shelter\u2014and parenting help. This is because women, or their parents on their behalf, favor polygynous marriages with wealthy men who have more resources to share.Researchers observed something else in their work.\"It turns out that monogamous mating (and marriage) can drive significant inequalities among women,\" Borgerhoff Mulder said. Monogamy, practiced in agricultural and market economies, can promote large differences in the number of children couples produce, researchers found, resulting from large differences in wealth in such economies.How humans may differThe fact men are relatively egalitarian compared to other animals reflects our patterns of child rearing. Human children are heavily dependent on the care and resources provided by both mothers and fathers\u2014a factor that is unusual, but not completely absent\u2014in other mammals, researchers said.The critical importance of the complementary nature of this care\u2014that that each parent provides different and often non-substitutable resources and care throughout long human childhoods\u2014is why we don't show the huge reproductive variability seen in some of the great apes, said researcher Paul Hooper, from the University of New Mexico.To support these inferences, however, anthropologists need more empirical data. \"In short, the importance of biparental care is grounded in our model, but needs further testing,\" Borgerhoff Mulder said.

    "text": "How does animal behavior emerge from networks of connected neurons? How are these incredible nervous systems and behaviors actually generated by evolution? Are there principles shared by all nervous systems or is evolution constantly innovating? What did the first nervous system look like that gave rise to the incredible diversity of life that we see around us?          Combining the study of animal behavior with studies of nervous system form, function, and evolution, Brandon \"Brady\" Weissbourd, a new faculty member in the Department of Biology and investigator in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, uses the tiny, transparent jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, a new neuroscience model.In 2021, you developed a new model organism for neuroscience research, the transparent jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica. How do these jellyfish answer questions about neuroscience, the nervous system, and evolution in ways that other models cannot?\r First, I believe in the importance of more broadly understanding the natural world and diversifying the organisms that we deeply study. One reason is to find experimentally tractable organisms to identify generalizable biological principles\u2014for example, we understand the basis of how neurons \"fire\" from studies of the squid giant axon. Another reason is that transformative breakthroughs have come from identifying evolutionary innovations that already exist in nature\u2014for example, green fluorescent protein (GFP, from jellyfish) or CRISPR (from bacteria). In both ways, this jellyfish is a valuable complement to existing models.I have always been interested in the intersection of two types of problems: how nervous systems generate our behaviors; and how these incredible systems were actually created by evolution.On the systems neuroscience side, ever since working on the serotonin system during my Ph.D. I have been fascinated by the problem of how animals control all of their behaviors simultaneously in a flexible and context-dependent manner, and how behavioral choices depend not just on incoming stimuli but on how those stimuli interact with constantly changing states of the nervous system and body. These are extremely complex and difficult problems, with the particular challenge of interactions across scales, from chemical signaling and dynamic cell biology to neural networks and behavior.To address these questions, I wanted to move into a model organism with exceptional experimental tractability.There have been exciting breakthroughs in imaging techniques for neuroscience, including these incredible ways in which we can actually watch and manipulate neuronal activity in a living animal. So, the first thing I wanted was a small and transparent organism that would allow for this kind of optical approach. These jellyfish are a few millimeters in diameter and perfectly transparent, with interesting behaviors but relatively compact nervous systems. They have thousands of neurons where we have billions, which also puts them at a nice intermediate complexity compared to other transparent models that are widely used\u2014for example, C. elegans have 302 neurons and larval zebrafish have something like 100,000 in the brain alone. These features will allow us to look at the activity of the whole nervous system in behaving animals to try to understand how that activity gives rise to behaviors and how that activity itself arises from networks of neurons.On the evolution side of our work, we are interested in the origins of nervous systems, what the first nervous systems looked like, and broadly what the options are for how nervous systems are organized and functioning: to what extent there are principles versus interesting and potentially useful innovations, and if there are principles, whether those are optimal or somehow constrained by evolution. Our last common ancestor with jellyfish and their relatives (the cnidarians) was something similar to the first nervous system, so by comparing what we find in cnidarians with work in other models we can make inferences about the origins and early evolution of nervous systems. As we further explore these highly divergent animals, we are also finding exciting evolutionary innovations: specifically, they have incredible capabilities for regenerating their nervous systems. In the future, it will be exciting to better understand how these neural networks are organized to allow for such robustness.      What work is required to develop a new organism as a model, and why did you choose this particular species of jellyfish?If you're choosing a new animal model, it's not just about whether it has the right features for the questions you want to ask, but also whether it technically lets you do the right experiments. The model we're using was first developed by a research group in France, who spent many years doing the really hard work of figuring out how to culture the whole life cycle in the lab, injecting eggs, and developing other key resources. For me, the big question was whether we'd be able to use the genetic tools that I was describing earlier for looking at neural activity. Working closely with collaborators in France, our first step was figuring out how to insert things into the jellyfish genome. If we couldn't figure that out, I was going to switch back to working with mice. It took us about two years of troubleshooting, but now we can routinely generate genetically modified jellyfish in the lab.Switching to a new animal model is tough\u2014I have a mouse neuroscience background and joined a postdoc lab that used mice and flies; I was the only person working with jellyfish, but had no experience. One of my goals is now to optimize and simplify this whole process so that when other labs want to start working with jellyfish we have a simple aquaculture platform to get them started, even if they have no experience.In addition to the fact that these things are tiny and transparent, the main reason that we chose this particular species is because it has an amazing life cycle that makes it an exciting laboratory animal.They have separate sexes that spawn daily with the fertilized eggs developing into larvae that then metamorphose into polyps. We grow these polyps on microscope slides, where they form colonies that are thought to be immortal. These colonies are then constantly releasing jellyfish, which are all genetically identical \"clones\" that can be used for experiments. That means that once you create a genetically modified strain, like a transgenic line or a knockout, you can keep it forever as a polyp colony\u2014and since the animals are so small, we can culture them in large numbers in the lab.There's still a huge amount of foundational work to do, like characterizing their behavioral repertoire and nervous system organization. It's shocking how little we know about the basics of jellyfish biology\u2014particularly considering that they kill more people per year than sharks and stingrays combined\u2014and the more we look into it, the more questions there are.What drew you to a faculty position at MIT?I wanted to be in a department that does fundamental research, is enthusiastic about basic science, is open-minded, and is very diverse in what people work on and think about. My goal is also to be able to ultimately link mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level to organismal behavior, which is something that [the] MIT [Department of] Biology is particularly strong at doing. It's been an exciting first few months! MIT Biology is such an amazing place to do science and it's been wonderful how enthusiastic and supportive everyone in the department has been.I was additionally drawn to MIT by the broader community and have already found it so easy to start collaborations with people in neuroscience, engineering, and math. I'm also thrilled to have recently become a member of The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, which further enables these collaborations in a way that I believe will be transformational for the work in my lab.It's a new lab. It's a new organism. There isn't a huge, well-established field that is taking these approaches. There's so much we don't know, and so much that we have to establish from scratch. My goal is for my lab to have a sense of adventure and fun, and I'm really excited to be doing that here in MIT Biology.

    "question_squad": " What is the threshold between energy-limited and water-limited systems?",
    "text": "Droughts can be good for trees; certain trees, that is.          Contrary to expectation, sometimes a record-breaking drought can increase tree growth. Why and where this happens is the subject of a new paper in Global Change Biology.A team of scientists led by Joan Dudney at UC Santa Barbara examined the drought response of endangered whitebark pine over the past century. They found that in cold, harsh environments\u2014often at high altitudes and latitudes\u2014drought can actually benefit the trees by extending the growing season. This research provides insights into where the threats from extreme drought will be greatest, and how different species and ecosystems will respond to climate change.Many factors can constrain tree growth, including temperature, sunlight and the availability of water and nutrients. The threshold between energy-limited and water-limited systems turns out to be particularly significant. Trees that try to grow in excessively cold temperatures\u2014often energy-limited systems\u2014can freeze to death. On the other hand, too little water can also kill a tree, particularly in water-limited systems. Over time, many tree species have adapted to these extreme conditions, and their responses are broadly similar. They often reduce growth-related activities, including photosynthesis and nutrient uptake, to protect themselves until the weather improves.\"Interestingly, the transition from energy- to water-limited growth can produce highly unexpected responses,\" explained Dudney, an assistant professor in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and the Environmental Studies Program. \"In cold, energy-limited environments, extreme drought can actually increase growth and productivity, even in California.\"Dudney and her colleagues extracted 800 tree cores from whitebark pine across the Sierra Nevada, comparing the tree rings to historical records of climate conditions. This climate data spanned 1900 to 2018, and included three extreme droughts: 1959\u201361, 1976\u201377, and 2012\u201315. They recorded where tree growth and temperature showed a positive relationship, and where the relationship was negative.      The authors found a pronounced shift in growth during times of drought when the average maximum temperature was roughly 8.4\u00b0 Celsius (47.1\u00b0 Fahrenheit) between October and May. Above this threshold, extreme drought reduced growth and photosynthesis. Below this temperature, trees grew more in response to drought.                A tree\u2019s location can drastically change its response to environmental changes. Credit: Joan Dudney et al.             \"It's basically 'How long is the growing season?'\" Dudney said. Colder winters and higher snowpack often lead to shorter growing seasons that constrain tree growth. Even during an extreme drought, many of the trees growing in these extreme environments did not experience high water stress. This surprised the team of scientists, many of whom had observed and measured the unprecedented tree mortality that occurred at slightly lower elevations in the Sierra Nevada.Dudney was curious about whether drought impacts growth in just the main trunk, or the whole tree. Without more data, the trends they saw could be a result of disparate processes all responding to the drought differently, she explained. Fortunately, whitebark pine retains its needles for roughly eight years. This provided additional data that could address this question.The researchers shifted their attention from dendrology to chemistry. Atoms of the same element can have different weights, or isotopes, thanks to the number of neutrons they contain. Several aspects of a plant's metabolism can influence the relative abundance of (heavy) carbon-13 and (light) carbon-12 in tissues such as their leaves and needles. These changes provide a rough guide to the amount of water stress a tree might have experienced during drought. This was a boon for the researchers, because isotopic data from the pine needles spanned drought and non-drought years.Analyzing needle growth, carbon and nitrogen isotopes revealed that the whole tree was affected by the threshold between water-limited and energy-limited systems. Trunk growth, needle growth, photosynthesis and nutrient cycling responded in opposite directions to drought above and below the threshold between energy- and water-limited systems.The future of whitebark pine is highly uncertain. The species\u2014recently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act\u2014faces many threats, including disease, pine beetle infestation and impacts from altered fire regimes. It's clear from this research that drought and warming will likely exacerbate these threats in water-limited regions, but warming may be beneficial for growth in energy-limited environments.\"This research can help develop more targeted conservation strategies,\" said Dudney, \"to help restore this historically widespread tree species.\" Indeed, the pine's range encompasses a diverse region, stretching from California to British Columbia, and east to Wyoming.The findings also have implications more broadly. Approximately 21% of forests are considered energy-limited, and an even higher percentage can be classified as water-limited. So transitions between these two climatic regimes likely occur around the globe. What's more, the transition seems to have an effect on nitrogen cycling. Trees in water-limited environments appeared to rely less on symbiotic fungi for nitrogen, which is critical for tree growth in harsh, energy-limited environments.\"Droughts are leading to widespread tree mortality across the globe,\" Dudney said, \"which can accelerate global warming.\"Deciphering the many ways trees respond to drought will help us better predict where ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and how to develop more targeted strategies to protect our forests.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the plant that forms lateral roots?",
    "text": "Along with sugar reallocation, a basic molecular mechanism within plants controls the formation of new lateral roots. An international team of plant biologists has demonstrated that it is based on the activity of a certain factor, the target of rapamycin (TOR) protein. A better understanding of the processes that regulate root branching at the molecular level could contribute to improving plant growth and therefore crop yields, according to research team leader Prof. Dr. Alexis Maizel of the Centre for Organismal Studies at Heidelberg University.          Good root growth ensures that plants can absorb sufficient nutrients and grow, thus contributing to their general fitness. To do that, they must align the available resources from metabolic processes with their genetic development programs. Plants bind carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere in their leaves and convert it to simple sugars via photosynthesis. In the form of fructose and glucose, these simple sugars are also allocated in the roots, where they drive the growth and development of the plant.Prof. Maizel's team used the thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant in plant research, to study how this process occurs at the molecular level. Their investigations focus on what role glucose plays in forming lateral roots. \"We do know that, besides plant hormones, sugar from the shoot is also allocated in the roots, but how the plant recognizes that sugar resources are available for forming lateral roots has not been understood thus far,\" explains Dr. Michael Stitz, a researcher on Alexis Maizel's team.The studies at the metabolism level showed that Arabidopsis forms lateral roots only when glucose breaks down and carbohydrates are consumed in the pericycle\u2014the outermost cell layer of the main root cylinder. This process is controlled at the molecular level by the target of rapamycin protein. This factor controls critical signal networks and metabolic processes in plants as well as in animals and humans. Its activity is governed by the interaction of growth factors like the plant hormone auxin and nutrients like sugar.Using Arabidopsis, the researchers discovered that TOR becomes active in the pericycle cells only when sugar is present there. So-called founder cells then form the lateral roots through cell division.Prof. Maizel says, \"TOR assumes a kind of gatekeeper role; when the plant activates the genetic growth program responsible for root formation via the hormone auxin, TOR checks whether there are sufficient sugar resources available for this process.\"TOR acts by controlling the translation of specific auxin-dependent genes, blocking their expression if there aren't sufficient sugar resources available. When the researchers suppressed TOR activity, no lateral roots were formed. \"That suggests that a fundamental molecular mechanism is involved,\" states the Heidelberg plant biologist.At the same time, the researchers demonstrated that TOR controls, via a similar mechanism, the formation of roots from other plant tissues\u2014the so-called adventitious roots. According to Prof. Maizel, the results from their investigations could also be of interest for agricultural applications. \"They could potentially be used to develop new strategies for plant growth optimized for various environmental conditions and better crop yields,\" says the researcher.The findings are published in The EMBO Journal.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the phenomenon where there are fluctuations in the ocean and atmosphere that affect the temperature and precipitation patterns in the region?",
    "text": "Perennial grasses are economically and biologically important in the Southwest U.S. region, but the abundance of these plants can change dramatically over time. There is concern that declines in grasses are becoming more common. Why grass cover changes, however, is poorly understood.          Scientists at the ARS's Jornada Experimental Range and Army Research Laboratory in N.M. used 100 years of measurements of perennial grass growth from their Long-Term Agroecosystem Research site to identify how climate controls abrupt changes in grass cover. The study showed that both periods of extreme loss and recovery have occurred.The long-term datasets, which go back to 1915, were recently used to construct models to understand the correlation between multiple timescales of climate fluctuations and the dynamics of grass cover, land degradation, and land restoration.\"We modeled years of dynamics of the grass community in correlation to climate drivers such as El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index. We found that perennial grass cover variations during the 20th century were closely tied to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index,\" said research ecologist Erica M. Christensen.The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a phenomenon where there are fluctuations in the ocean and atmosphere that affect the temperature and precipitation patterns in the region. This index goes through two phases\u2014positive and negative\u2014which each last for about 20 to 30 years.According to the model, grasses do well under a positive PDO phase, and opportunities for increases in grass cover may occur with the return of a positive PDO phase in forthcoming years.Recent observations, however, indicate that land degradation, including shrub encroachment and associated soil erosion or increased temperatures, may be preventing the expected increases in grass cover with PDO.The team of scientists hopes land managers can use predictions from these models to time restoration actions to coincide with the positive PDO phase.\"The next positive PDO phase might be the best opportunity to invest in restoration practices, such as shrub removal or erosion control, to allow grasses to capitalize on relatively favorable conditions,\" said research leader Brandon Bestelmeyer.The paper is published in the journal Ecology.

    "question_squad": " How many bee species were observed in Ohio in 2017 and 2018?",
    "text": "A new study has identified the bee's knees of bumble bee dietary options in Ohio and the Upper Midwest.          By viewing almost 23,000 bumble bee-flower interactions over two years, researchers found that these bees don't always settle for the most abundant flowers in their foraging area\u2014suggesting they have more discerning dietary preferences than one might expect.Being large, strong and social bees that can fly for long distances, bumble bees are major contributors to pollination, particularly for agriculture\u2014but like other pollinators threatened by habitat loss, climate change and disease, the numbers of some species are dwindling.This new data can help guide planting decisions for professional and amateur conservationists alike, researchers say.\"Getting over 20,000 observations of individual identified bumble bees visiting particular flower species is pretty incredible for a dataset,\" said Karen Goodell, senior author of the study and a professor of evolution, ecology and organismal biology at The Ohio State University's Newark campus. \"One of the keys for this project was having flower associations, as well as estimates of flower abundance, so we counted the flowers, too.\"In no particular order, the top flower species preferred by an aggregate of bumble bee species in Ohio are milkweed, native thistles, morning glory, purple cone flower, bee balm, beardtongue, red clover, vetch and rosinweed, or cup plant. Two other \"bee magnet\" plants in low abundance that were crawling with the fuzzy buzzers are Culver's root and wild indigo.The study was published recently in the journal Ecosphere.Of the 16 bumble bee species historically found in Ohio, researchers observed only 10 species, eight of which were abundant enough to include in the analysis\u2014including the American Bumble Bee (Bombus pensylvanicus), which is under consideration for addition to the Federal Endangered Species List. As expected, the most frequently observed species\u201411,555 visits in all\u2014was the Common Eastern Bumble Bee (Bombus impatiens), compared to only 31 observations of the American Bumble Bee.In fact, despite the extensive sampling, the authors are confident in the range of preferred flowers for only the three most common species. For the five less common species, researchers didn't witness enough bee-flower interactions to fully account for what they eat. That sparseness of data on the rarer species speaks to the need for this comprehensive analysis, researchers said.      \"It's really important to know what species we do have and what they like to eat, because any of them could become rare,\" Goodell said. \"It's not like we're doing a fantastic job of taking care of our natural areas. The more information we have about their preferences, the better we can manage their habitat.\"Research team members visited 228 locations in Ohio during the summer months of 2017 and 2018, for a total of 477 hours, and observed bumble bees interacting with 96 different species of wildflowers. The sites included unmanaged fields, restored roadsides and meadows, and planted urban patches and hayfields.The data analysis showed strong nonrandom patterns of bumble bee visits to flowers, meaning the bees selected specific plants in greater proportion than their availability would suggest. Researchers used a selection index to gauge bees' flower preferences that compared the frequency of bumble bee species visits to the flowers' overall percent abundance.\"What we were trying to get at was if all else is equal, what do they actually prefer?\" said first author Jessie Lanterman Novotny, who led much of the project as an Ohio State Ph.D. student and postdoctoral researcher in Goodell's lab. \"There were flowers that were less abundant that bees actively sought out\u2014they didn't necessarily eat what was most abundant. There were also plants they avoided: No matter how many of certain flowers there were, they said, 'No thanks'.\"The researchers identified a few plants that are highly abundant and commonly used in pollinator conservation plantings and seed mixes that bumble bees consistently ignored, including alsike clover, black-eyed Susan and prairie cone flower. Five of the eight bumble bee species also were strongly drawn to non-native plants, which poses a dilemma for conservation planters focused on preserving native plant species.And it turns out the three most common species don't all feast at the same flower 'table'.\"We compared the flowers each bumble bee species used the most, and species only overlapped by one-third or less,\" said Lanterman Novotny, now a visiting assistant professor of biology at Hiram College. \"Low overlap could relieve competition, so all these species can coexist together.\"Additional co-authors included former Ohio State PhD student Andrew Lybbert, now at Methodist University, and Paige Reeher and Randall Mitchell of the University of Akron.

    "text": "A new study from Lund University in Sweden shows that the ability of microorganisms to adapt to climate warming will slow down global warming by storing carbon in soil.          In the study, researchers collected soil samples from across Europe in a wide range of temperatures, from minus 3.1\u00b0C to 18.3\u00b0C. The samples revealed that microorganisms in soils\u2014such as bacteria and fungi\u2014are strongly adapted to their local climate when it comes to growth and respiration. However, the researchers surprisingly demonstrated that microorganisms can adapt to temperature changes. The organisms can even benefit from these changes.\"Despite decades of scientific pondering, researchers have not been able to determine whether microorganisms can adapt to warming, and if they do. We can now confirm that this is the case, and that the organisms can actually mitigate climate warming,\" says Carla Cruz Paredes, a biology researcher at Lund University.The new study, published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, also reveals that groups of microorganisms react differently to warming. Bacteria and fungi differ in their sensitivity to temperature changes, with bacteria being more sensitive than fungi. Moreover, microbial growth is more sensitive to temperature changes than respiration. These differences in temperature sensitivity have important implications for predictions of future carbon losses and storage, as well as how the soil is affected by climate warming.\"The outcome of these varying sensitivities to growth and respiration at different temperatures, and between bacteria and fungi, will impact the carbon balance between the soil and the atmosphere, and thus the soil's feedback on climate warming,\" says Carla Cruz Paredes.The study highlights the importance of accurately representing microbial responses to climate warming in models of soil carbon content. The research also shows that ecological responses from the Earth's microorganisms will play a key role in regulating the planet's climate.\"Climate warming is one of the biggest threats to our environment. To mitigate global warming, it is necessary to enhance the soil's ability to store or sequester carbon and reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere. This study is a step forward in providing better predictions for the assessments of the UN's climate panel,\" says Carla Cruz Paredes.

    "question_squad": " What is honokiol?",
    "text": "A compound called honokiol, which is found in the bark of multiple species of magnolia tree, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in several types of cells, according to a team of researchers in the Netherlands. The research is published in Microbiology Spectrum.          The researchers found that honokiol inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in several cell types, causing production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in treated cells to fall to around 1,000th of the previous level.The compound also inhibited replication of other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including MERS- and SARS-CoV. \"This suggests that it has a broad spectrum of activity and would likely also inhibit novel coronaviruses that might emerge in the future,\" said Martijn J. van Hemert, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.The motivation for the research was the lack of vaccines and treatments early in the pandemic, and the desire to be prepared for the next new coronavirus. To this end, van Hemert emphasized that his group, as well as others from around the world, responded to COVID-19 by testing many compounds for antiviral effects.\"If honokiol can be developed into a drug, possibly in combination with other compounds, stockpiling it would help us to increase our preparedness for the emergence of the next coronavirus,\" said van Hemert. \"Broad-spectrum drugs could then be used to treat early patients and prevent spread, or they could be used prophylactically among healthcare workers, and in high-risk groups, such as among nursing home residents.\"Honokiol also has anti-inflammatory properties, van Hemert noted. That, he said, could be helpful in cases where patients wait until a relatively late stage of the disease to obtain medical treatment\u2014a frequent occurrence\u2014by which time the body's own inflammatory responses to the infection are causing symptoms. \"At that point, inhibition of virus replication might no longer be helpful, but honokiol's anti-inflammatory response might mitigate the illness,\" van Hemert explained.Honokiol inhibits a later step of the viral replication cycle\u2014one that takes place after the virus has entered the cell. The investigators suspect that honokiol does so by triggering processes in the host cell that impede replication of the virus. It did so in the case of the original SARS-CoV-2 variants, and also in that of the more recent omicron variants.At this early stage in the research, \"Our study merely provides the basis for further research into potential therapeutic applications,\" said van Hemert. \"It is important to mention that it is too early to claim that honokiol might be used in SARS-CoV-2 patients. This requires much more research and\u2014if successful\u2014properly conducted clinical trials.\"Van Hemert learned about honokiol from Jack Arbiser, M.D., Ph.D., of Emory School of Medicine, during the early stages of the pandemic. Arbiser had been researching honokiol's anticancer properties, and he told van Hemert he thought that the effects of the compound on the host cell might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19 patients as well.Clarisse Salgado-Benvindo, a Ph.D. student in van Hemert's group, performed most of the experiments, using cultured cells that the researchers infected with SARS-CoV-2, or the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Experimenters worked inside a BSL-3 lab, which is a special high containment lab, while wearing protective suits with full-face masks to prevent infection.

    "text": "Identifying the factors contributing to algal growth accurately and reliably is vital for sustainable use and scientific management of freshwater resources. As scientific research evolves from using small data sets to larger ones, the shortcomings of traditional machine learning become clearer, and deep learning which is adept at processing large amounts of data, is getting more attention.          Although it has been used occasionally for forecasting chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) time series, deep learning has rarely been employed to identify important factors concerning algal growth.To address this gap, a cross-national team of researchers from China, Germany and The Netherlands developed a deep learning-based Transformer model, Bloomformer-1, designed for end-to-end identification of algal growth driving factors.\"Deep learning models have lower operational transparency compared to traditional machine learning, but they exhibit significant advantages in performance,\" said Jing Qian, the first author of the paper. \"The development of Bloomformer-1 aims to create a win-win situation in terms of interpretability and performance, enabling the driving factors of algal growth to be identified transparently and accurately.\"Qian, a doctoral student from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, conducted this research as a jointly-cultivated doctoral student at the Institute of Hydrobiology in China.The Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MRP), a national large-scale project in China, was selected as the study site to demonstrate the superior performance of Bloomformer-1. It was compared to four widely used traditional machine learning models\u2014extra trees regression (ETR), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and multiple linear regression (MLR)\u2014with the highest R2 (0.80 to 0.94) and lowest RMSE (0.22 to 0.43 \u03bcg/L).\"Bloomformer-1 employs the multi-head-self-attention mechanism, which compares each token in the input sequence with other tokens to collect and learn dynamic contextual information, thus enabling a thorough understanding of all the field sampling data. This is one of the reasons for its superior performance,\" said co-author Stefan Norra from the University of Potsdam.The results of study, published in Water Biology & Security, revealed that total phosphorus (TP) was the most significant factor affecting the MRP, especially in the Henan section, while total nitrogen (TN) had the most substantial impact on algal growth in the Hebei section.\"Controlling and reducing phosphorus is an important strategy for controlling algal growth and maintaining stable MRP water quality, while nitrogen control in the Hebei region is also worth paying attention to,\" said Yonghong Bi from the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is the corresponding author of the study. \"Furthermore, the promotion and application of Bloomformer-1 in other water bodies will be an important task going forward.\" More information:Jing Qian et al, Identification of driving factors of algal growth in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project by Transformer-based deep learning, Water Biology and Security (2023).

    "text": "Philosopher Thomas Kuhn's influential theory of how scientific knowledge is built introduced the term \"paradigm shift\" to explain a transformation of a field's ideas and methods. \"A Paradigm Shift, or a Paradigm Adjustment? The Evolution of the Oleaceae Mating System as a Small-Scale Kuhnian Case Study,\" a new paper published in The Quarterly Review of Biology, seeks to apply this analytical framework to a small controversy in population biology: the mating system of the shrub Phillyrea angustifolia.          Traditional theory states that the sex ratio of a population should be 1:1 male to female (or highly skewed towards hermaphrodites in male-hermaphrodite populations). But natural populations of P. angustifolia, a shrub in the olive family native to the Mediterranean, have unexpected high frequencies of males, note authors Alexandre Francq, Pierre Saumitou-Laprade, Philippe Vernet, and Sylvain Billiard.Several possible solutions were floated to resolve this paradigm crisis. One postulated that hermaphroditic individuals were functionally female. Another suggested that a mechanism known as self-incompatibility made it so pollen emitted by males was more successful at fertilization than pollen emitted by hermaphrodites (and also eliminated the advantage of self-fertilization in hermaphrodites).The issue was ultimately resolved with the discovery of the link between a distortion segregation biased towards males and a diallelic self-incompatibility system, which advantaged male reproductive fitness. \"Hermaphrodites can reproduce through their ovules and pollen, while males can only reproduce through their pollen, but hermaphrodites can only sire approximately one-half of the hermaphrodites \u2026 while males can sire all hermaphrodites,\" the authors explain.Francq, Saumitou-Laprade, Vernet, and Billiard use several criteria to analyze if this discovery and change comports to Kuhn's theory and represents a true paradigm shift, or only a paradigm adjustment. While the question of P. angustifolia's sex ratio is a small one, the authors conclude it is indeed an example of an anomaly and associated crisis, central concepts in Kuhn's theory.And while the discovery \"did not change anything to the way most biologists of evolution practice science, it drastically changed the way groups dedicated to plant mating systems pursued their research.\"The question also embodies several examples of what Kuhn called the incommensurability of paradigms. These include the possibility that the same hermaphroditic P. angustifolia plant could be considered functionally as a female, in one paradigm or true hermaphrodites, in another, and the fact that different specialty fields studying the problem were too distinct from each other and unable to operate on common ground, the authors say.Resistances to the shift also arose after the discovery of the mating system, an inherent component to Kuhn's theory, and the authors also discuss possible future challenges to the new paradigm.Ultimately, the authors conclude that the discovery of the diallelic self-incompatibility system in P. angustifolia does indeed fulfill the conditions necessary to constitute a paradigm shift.\"Overall, a Kuhnian analysis of this small-scale case study offers a unique opportunity to analyze how science works in action, study some phenomena that are rarely observed for high-level paradigms (e.g., scientists' conversion from the old to the new paradigm), and thoroughly analyze the roles played by the confrontation between models and data in a paradigm shift,\" the authors write.

    "text": "Natural landscapes are continually transformed to make room for agricultural and urban developments\u2014often at the expense of important habitats and species.          That's why, to avoid unnecessary species extinctions, it's crucial to know which habitats to protect. In a recent paper we studied how changes to the landscape affected butterflies in a grassland area of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.The sheer speed at which landscapes are being transformed by human activity means that conservationists simply don't have the time to gather detailed information on all the species in a particular region. That slows down conservation responses. It's also not always possible to conserve entire landscapes and doing so is not always economically feasible.Butterflies are icons in the sky. On warm summer days we can watch them dance elegantly from flower to flower. But they aren't just beautiful to look at. They are important pollinators, and are important in natural food chains. For scientists, they are sentinel species. By identifying how they interact with landscapes we gain a better understanding of how other insect species do, too.Our research offers a closer look at how butterflies interact with the landscapes they roam. This, in turn, allows us to delve into how conservation measures can be adopted to better protect butterfly communities against the effects of people changing natural habitats.We found that a variety of different grassland types, in addition to flower diversity, is important for butterflies. When it's not possible to conserve whole grassland areas, a variety of smaller grassland patches can help protect butterflies and other insects against environmental transformation. This means that effective insect conservation is possible in areas earmarked for large-scale transformation\u2014without sacrificing economic gain.      The landscape Timber estates occupy a large proportion of the grassland landscape in the KwaZulu-Natal province, where we conducted our study. This leaves little habitat for grassland butterflies in some areas.To ensure that the biological impact of plantation forestry is minimized, forestry practitioners have moved towards leaving at least a third of natural grasslands untouched among timber plantations. This provides butterflies and other insects with enough habitat to roam the landscape while timber production continues in other sections.But this approach raises an important question: does it matter which grasslands are set aside for conservation? Or is one grassland much the same as another?The butterflies Many butterfly species roam in high elevation habitats, like the Mistbelt Grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal province. The area also forms part of one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.                A Geranium bronze butterfly settles on some flowers in the study area. Credit: Charl Deacon             Inconspicuous species such as the Natal spotted blue (Azanus natalensis) and the Meadow blue (Cupidopsis cissus cissus), along with large and showy species such as the Mountain pride (Aeropetes tulbaghia), frequent grasslands in the region. A keen eye might even spot some magisterial species briefly darting over, like the Flying handkerchief (Papilio dardanus cenea). Strikingly, these species and their counterparts rarely enter timber plantation compartments; they rely on grassland habitats.We recorded and counted as many butterfly species as we could, allowing us to determine just how important natural grassland habitats are among plantation compartments. The results were clear\u2014butterflies need grassland habitats to outlive human transformation.Not that simple There is a catch. Conserving only one or a few feature grassland types won't protect all butterfly species.Our results show that grasslands of similar types vary considerably. Each grassland has a set of characteristics that defines them such as availability of sunlight during the day, resistance to fire outbreaks and richness of flowering plants. These characteristics are important for attracting particular butterfly species that would avoid another type of grassland.Butterflies are highly mobile insects. Many species rely on small elevation variations to complete their day-to-day tasks. In particular, butterflies move up and down the elevation gradient to avoid, or catch, more sun. This means it's important for butterflies to have access to habitats at various elevations throughout the day.Butterfly population levels are also highly variable between seasons and from one year to the next. During times when feeding and breeding resources are scarce, butterfly populations may be more concentrated in areas where resources are more reliable. Resources are often more reliable in nature reserves, meaning that butterflies need to access them.When grassland patches among plantations are connected to nature reserves at the landscape level, they are more accessible to moving butterflies. This means that butterfly diversity is higher in grasslands that are close to, and connected to, neighboring protected areas.All of this is important information because it can help in guiding decisions about where to focus grassland conservation efforts in the region.Next steps Our study shows that landscape variety is best and that taking this landscape-scale variety into consideration in conservation practices can greatly counteract human impact on natural systems.In viewing butterflies as sentinels in conservation, we can use this information to decide which grasslands to conserve, or restore, to better protect all their insect residents.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the new map that depicts the human body's highly evolved system for addressing and repairing DNA damage?",
    "text": "Writing in the May 22, 2023 issue of Cell Systems, a diverse team of scientists, led by researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, have produced a novel map that depicts the human body's enormously complicated and highly evolved system for addressing and repairing DNA damage\u2014a cause and consequence of many diseases.          Damage to DNA and replication errors caused by stress and other factors play a major role in disease, and are a hallmark of cancer and other afflictions. To maintain the integrity of the genome and support normal functioning and health, cells have evolved an intricate network of cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair tools, collectively known as DNA damage response or DDR.Defects in DDR are linked to numerous diseases, including cancer and heritable neurological disorders caused by unstable DNA, erroneous repeats, rearrangements and mutations. Conversely, better understanding how DDR works and why it sometimes fails provides new therapeutic opportunities to treat or cure the same diseases.\"The ongoing challenge, of course, is that DDR is an extremely complex system involving hundreds of different proteins assembling in different ways to address different problems,\" said senior author Trey Ideker, Ph.D., professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine and UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center. \"You can't fix a problem with DDR until you understand how it works.\"In the new paper, Ideker and colleagues take a major step forward in elucidating the complexities and functions of DDR, producing a multi-scale map of protein assemblies in DDR.Unlike earlier maps, based on published scientific literature that included conflicting findings or tend to focus only on well-studied mechanisms, the new reference map employs affinity purification mass spectrometry and a broad collection of multi-omics data to develop a fuller picture: a hierarchical organization of 605 proteins in 109 assemblies that captures canonical repair mechanisms and proposes new DDR-associated proteins linked to stress, transport and chromatin functions within cells.Multi-omics is a new approach in which data sets of different omics groups are combined during analysis to create a more complete and nuanced understanding of whole systems and organisms.The cell contains different classes of molecular processes: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and others. Each of these \"omics\" molecular processes involves interactions between thousands of genes, transcripts or proteins. To make sense of this complexity, scientists have tended to take a reductionist view, examining omics one at a time.      In contrast, systems biology considers molecular processes simultaneously and holistically, using machine learning and other tools to evaluate to what extent different molecular processes inform any given interaction, and how whole systems and networks work. Machine learning describes computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions. It is an application of artificial intelligence.\"Experimental screens of ever-increasing scale are capturing interactions between genes or proteins in human cells, often beyond what has been described in literature. They can, in principle, be used to create data-driven maps of DDR,\" said first author Anton Kratz, Ph.D., formerly a research scientist in Ideker's lab who now works at The System Biology Institute in Tokyo, Japan.But screening presents its own challenges since different forms may measure molecular processes in isolation, missing some interactions that appear only under certain stresses or conditions. To address these challenges, the researchers measured new protein-protein interaction networks centered around 21 key DDR factors with and without DNA damage. They developed a machine learning approach to combine new data with existing data, and statistical analysis that showed the results significantly informed the resulting map.\"To me, two things were most revelatory,\" said Kratz. \"First, the sheer amount of novel proteins in the map. About 50% of the proteins included in the map following our data-driven paradigm were not included in the literature-curated maps considered here, justifying a data-driven approach to building the map.\"Second and related to that, membership to DDR is not a binary affair, but takes place on a continuum (and we quantify this continuum), extending to stress, transport, and chromatin functions.\" More information:Anton Kratz et al, A multi-scale map of protein assemblies in the DNA damage response, Cell Systems (2023).

    "text": "Imagine coming across an injured kangaroo on the side of the road. Or a bat entangled in fruit tree netting. Would you know who to call to get help?          After a quick search, you find the number of your local wildlife rescue service and give them a call. A trained operator gathers the information they need to assess your case and coordinate rescue and rehabilitation if needed.Across Australia, wildlife emergency response hotlines, such as Wildlife Victoria in Victoria, WIRES in New South Wales and smaller groups throughout the country, offer valuable help to wildlife and members of the public who encounter wildlife emergencies. Data from these services can also help us understand how human activities harm wildlife at a local level. And that in turn highlights what can be done to better protect wildlife.In newly published research, our team analyzed a ten-year dataset from Wildlife Victoria, the main wildlife emergency response service in that state. The service responded to more than 30,000 cases a year, on average, between 2010 and 2019. Around 400 cases a year involved threatened species.Human activities are the greatest threatMany such services operate on a daily basis. They collect enormous amounts of information on human and non-human threats to wildlife, particularly in urban areas.When you call a service about an animal, a rescuer might need to attend or, if safe to do so, you might be asked to take the animal to a vet clinic free of charge for assessment. Or it might be that the animal, such as a fledgling bird on the ground, just needs to be left alone.Confirming what studies in Australia and elsewhere have shown, our results demonstrate that human activities do the most harm to wildlife, as opposed to more natural causes such as severe weather or being preyed on by other animals. A majority of cases were reported in the Greater Melbourne area rather than the rest of the state.                A rescued wombat joey. Credit: Elodie Camprasse, Author provided             As might be expected, common species accounted for most cases. Eastern gray kangaroos, ringtail and brushtail possums and magpies were the most commonly reported species.Of 443 identified species reported to the service, 81 were listed as threatened. The majority of cases involving threatened species (on the Fauna and Flaura Guarantee Act 1988 Threatened List) concerned gray-headed flying foxes.Generally, the main causes for concern were collisions with vehicles, animals found in an abnormal location (an unnatural habitat where they did not belong) or in buildings, and attacks by cats or dogs.Some species were disproportionately impacted by some threats rather than others and in some locations. For example, kangaroos and koalas were more likely to be victims of vehicle collisions outside Greater Melbourne. In contrast, ringtail possums were more likely to be attacked by cats within the metropolitan area.Flying foxes were more frequently reported within Greater Melbourne. The main cause of concern was entanglements in nets such as fruit tree netting. The data thus confirmed the danger these nets present.      Services struggle to keep up with demandWorryingly, Wildlife Victoria recorded a 2.5-fold increase in reported cases from 2010 to 2019.However, such services are often under-resourced. While the number of cases increased, the number of volunteers able to respond to cases did not. This means a lower proportion of all cases can receive the support they need.                Eastern grey kangaroos are among the most commonly rescued animals. Credit: Elodie Camprasse, Author provided             Using data from services such as Wildlife Victoria can help us understand service-demand gaps and where resources would be best allocated to fill these gaps.We also showed such services provide invaluable education to the community. Around one in five calls resulted in education, rather than requiring an emergency response.Databases are a largely untapped resourceWildlife emergency response services have a wealth of data that describe the species-specific and location-specific threats wildlife face. Local wildlife managers and organizations interested in protecting wildlife from common threats before they occur could use this data to understand what they can do to achieve this.For example, the data can help pinpoint where measures such as educating the community on responsible pet ownership, banning the sale of dangerous netting or wire and reducing speed limits would be effective depending on the wildlife affected in specific areas.The data could also help monitor the success of new laws, campaigns and measures to protect wildlife. For example, researchers in Queensland have used data from their local wildlife rescue services to quantify the reduction in koala deaths from car strikes and dog attacks following a campaign to raise awareness of threats to koalas. This source of information is invaluable because such data can be hard and costly for ecologists and conversationists to collect.Interested in interacting with Wildlife Victoria's historical data?

    "text": "New research led by Carnegie's Yixian Zhen and Minjie Hu reveals how coral cells tag friendly algae before ingesting them, initiating a mutually beneficial relationship. This information could guide next-level coral conservation efforts.          Their work is published in Nature Microbiology.Corals are marine invertebrates that build large exoskeletons from which reefs are constructed. But this architecture is only possible because of a mutually beneficial relationship between the coral and various species of single-celled algae called dinoflagellates that live inside individual coral cells. These algae convert the sun's energy into food using a process called photosynthesis and they share some of the nutrients they produce with their coral hosts.Coral reefs have great ecological, economic, and aesthetic value. Many communities depend on them for food and tourism. Despite this, human activity is putting strain on these fragile communities. Warming oceans, pollution, and acidification all affect this symbiotic relationship.\"Many corals are particularly sensitive to elevated temperatures,\" explained Hu. \"As oceans heat up, they lose algae, starve due to the lack of nutrients, and die off, a phenomenon called bleaching, because it leaves the coral skeleton looking ghostly white.\"                An illustration showing how LePin tags (shown in blue) are secreted from the coral cell and used to mark algae for uptake. Credit: Navid Marvi, Carnegie Institution for Science.             For several years, teams of Carnegie researchers, including Zheng and Hu, have been elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning coral-algae symbiosis. Understanding these processes could inform strategies to prevent bleaching and promote coral resilience.In this new study, the researchers\u2014including Carnegie's Yun Bai and Xiaobin Zheng\u2014deployed sophisticated bioinformatic and molecular biology tools to reveal the early steps of symbiosis, during which the algae are taken up into the coral. They found a molecule called LePin, which the coral secretes. It is concentrated in the mouth of corals, where it may bind to incoming algae, marking them for uptake into coral cells.\"Understanding how corals tell which algae to take up is an important step in gathering information that will help us mitigate coral bleaching,\" Zheng said.LePin is evolutionarily conserved among soft corals, stony corals, and anemones that perform symbiosis with algae, which means that it could be a good target for efforts to genetically engineer at-risk corals to increase their hardiness in the face of temperature increases.\"Gaining a deeper understanding of LePin could enable us to differentiate how some species of coral are better able to identify and take up heat-resistant algae than others,\" Zheng explained. \"Once isolated, the LePin sequences that are capable of identifying hardier and more heat-resistant algae could be transplanted into vulnerable coral populations to reduce bleaching events.\" More information:Minjie Hu, Coral\u2013algal endosymbiosis characterized using RNAi and single-cell RNA-seq, Nature Microbiology (2023).

    "text": "Early detection of pest infestation is an important first step in the adoption of control measures that can be tailored to specific local conditions. Remote sensing technology can be a helpful tool, allowing the quick scanning of large areas, but it's not universally applicable as sometimes items can be hard to detect. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, on the other hand, can help by getting closer to individual trees and detecting smaller atypical signals.          The pine processionary moth is an insect infesting trees in gardens and parks, threatening public health because of the hairs released by its larvae, which can cause a stinging or itching sensation. The pest is rapidly growing in numbers and conquering new territories, which makes it a species of concern.In a new study, researchers tested different deep learning methods to detect the nests made by pine processionary moth larvae on pine and cedar trees. Drones flying over the trees took images, which were then analyzed with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and localize the nests.The use of AI on drone images proved effective to detect pine processing moth nests on trees of different species and sizes, even under variable densities. The method can be successfully used in both forest and urban settings to help detect moth nests. That way, tree health managers can be informed about where the nests are and take appropriate measures to contain the damage and the public health risks.\"The study proved the advantage of using UAVs to document the presence of at least one nest per tree,\" the researchers write in their study, which was published in a special issue of the journal NeoBiota dedicated to forest pests in Europe. \"It therefore represents a substantial step forward in the integration of the UAV survey with ground observations in the monitoring of the colonies of an important forest defoliating insect in the Mediterranean area.\"                Location of the study sites and types of habitat a stand of Pinus pinea in Portugal b stand of Pinus pinaster in France c stand of Pinus nigra in Italy.

    "text": "Nettles, dandelions, brambles: weeds\u2014once considered a scourge\u2014are taking pride of place at London's Chelsea Flower Show as gardeners concern themselves more than ever with biodiversity and sustainable development.          Around 145,000 visitors, including King Charles III and Queen Camilla, are expected to attend the five-day annual horticultural extravaganza starting on Tuesday, one of the most popular of its kind worldwide.Visitors can enjoy a selection of specially planted gardens showcasing themes and trends.In 2022, the gold medal went to a garden celebrating rewilding after the reintroduction of beavers to the southwestern England.This year, no less than one third of the 12 main gardens in competition feature weeds such as nettles, knapweed, dandelions, chickweed or buttercups that generations of gardeners have spent their lives rooting out.Six-time Chelsea Flower Show gold-medal landscape designer Cleve West has managed to include 19 weed species in his garden for the Centrepoint Association.West said the garden, constructed around the dilapidated remains of a 19th-century house, was for him the perfect metaphor for the young homeless people the charity cares for, who shouldn't be written off.Biodiversity\"Weeds play a very significant part in repairing land. When land has been disturbed, weeds are the first things that go. They are pioneer plants that go in and repair the soil,\" he told AFP.                Designer Cleve West includes 19 weed species in his creation for the Chelsea Flower Show.             \"They sort of have a microbial activity in the soil that helps make soils healthy, fertile and it provides food for early pollinators\u2014even homes for some invertebrates,\" he said.\"So they play a very important part in biodiversity.\"This is the first time he has planted weeds in a competition garden.He says he is fascinated by all \"the life forms they support\" and urges gardeners to make space for them if possible to discover the \"intricacies involved in how plants grow together\".Jilayne Rickards has designed the \"Fauna and Flora\" garden, which invites visitors on an eco-trek to Rwanda's Virunga mountains in the footsteps of gorillas and includes a spectacular waterfall.\"Thistles and brambles and nettles... this is typical gorilla habitat,\" she said of the weed species that she cultivated in Cornwall, southwestern England.                Using weeds fits into the greater emphasis this year on rewilding and sustainability.             \"We spend a lot of time ripping these things out of our garden, not aware of perhaps the amount of wildlife and biodiversity it actually supports,\" she said.Another garden, designed by landscape architect Tom Massey with a laboratory dome, is devoted to the role and understanding of insects. Here again, weeds have their place, including dandelions and clover.The concept of celebrating weeds, however, is not without its critics at a show famed for the creativity and meticulousness of its beautiful gardens.\"The war against traditional gardens is about to go nuclear,\" is how conservative newspaper The Daily Telegraph summed up the latest weed-friendly trend.      'Traditionalists'Celebrity gardener Alan Titchmarsh told Country Life magazine the aim of the Royal Horticultural Society's flagship show was to reward gardening excellence.                    Not everyone is happy about the inclusion of species such as dandelions and thistle.                                     The RHS hopes including weeds will dispel myths about gardening being only for traditionalists.                                     Designer Jilayne Rickards says weeds support wildlife and biodiversity.                 This was being \"obscured\", he said, by a need to show gardeners were not \"dyed-in-the-wool traditionalists\" but \"vibrant folk with a finger on the current environmentalist pulse\", he said.Even so, weeds have not yet succeeded at complete domination.The 12 main gardens in competition\u2014out of a total of 36\u2014use an average of 3,000 different plants. The smallest, dedicated to balconies and potted plants, has around a hundred.Themes range from edible plants\u2014with a chef using them to prepare meals\u2014to Korean herbal medicine, wellness and listening.All the gardens will be recycled, donated for example to a hospital or communities.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Weeds grow at London's Chelsea Flower Show (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-weeds-london-chelsea.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the main reason that salt tolerance has not been released for commercial use?",
    "text": "Despite years of effort and advances in understanding how salinity tolerance works in plants, very few salt-tolerant crops have been released for commercial use.          In a comprehensive review of breeding salinity tolerance in plants published in the journal Annual Review of Plant Biology, KAUST researchers Vanessa Melino and Mark Tester argue that the main reason research advances have not been translated into commercial salt-tolerant crop varieties for farmers is that this has not been a priority for plant breeders. However, with increasing impacts of climate change due to sea-level rise and storm surges forcing seawater further inland, the need to increase crop salinity tolerance is becoming more urgent, and so priorities must change.The authors say more effort is needed to deliver research advances to improve performance of crops in salt-affected areas.\"We need to reassess old techniques, such as grafting current crops with salt-tolerant hybrid rootstocks. Also, future crops can be produced by domesticating salt-tolerant wild species\u2014an approach that is feasible in our lifetime,\" says Tester, who, after years researching salt-tolerant plants, co-founded RedSea, a company that is producing crops using saltwater in water-scarce environments.Increasing salinity in irrigation water is another threat. As groundwater is depleted, soil quality falls and soil salinity increases.\"Anything we can do to reduce the use of groundwater for food production, including the use of brackish water instead of fresh water in agricultural systems, will increase the sustainability of food production,\" says Tester.While much salinity-tolerance research has focused on cereals, the authors encourage targeting a wider range of plants\u2014especially crops with high nutritional value, such as fruit and vegetables.Using wild plantsFor some crops, the use of close crop wild relatives\u2014species that can hybridize with the crop species\u2014is a promising option. Crops such as wheat, which have relatively limited natural variation in salinity tolerance, would benefit significantly from such wide crosses. Other crops, like tomatoes, which have good abilities to hybridize with wild relatives, can also exploit such opportunities.New genetic tools provide a way to introduce salinity tolerance traits from distant crop wild relatives or even to domesticate salt-tolerant wild species.\"This will require a paradigm shift away from the crops we are familiar with to the evolution of new crops from plants that are currently wild and have an extraordinary ability to thrive in extreme environments,\" says Melino, who leads research at KAUST into the salt-tolerant plant Salicornia as a potential oilseed crop.A key challenge in the domestication of new crops is the need to overcome the often opposing selective pressures on wild plants and crops. Wild plants must be highly responsive to changes in their local environment as they are in competition with other plant species, grazed by animals and affected by disease. By contrast, domesticated plants are usually less responsive to their environment and are selected for traits associated with time-limited production\u2014particularly challenging when identifying wild plants from marginal environments, such as saline soils, suitable for domestication.\"The first step of selecting which crop wild relative to domesticate is critical and involves capturing as much genetic diversity as possible,\" explains Melino. These accessions should then be screened for yield, quality traits and other important tendencies to domestication in saline environments.      Closing the gap between discovery and delivery of researchThe authors believe the lack of progress in development of salt-tolerant varieties is due to plant breeders' focus on maximizing national yields, which means they target percentage increases in higher-yield environments. Although lower-yield environments can cover large areas of land, percentage increases in these environments result in a smaller percentage increase in national output. But the authors point out, farmers who live on these poorer lands still need to maintain decent yields and, in the process, they make a major contribution to national and global food security.Researchers need to also take into consideration improvements in farmers livelihoods, rather than simply prioritizing national outputs. \"Even if increases in yields are modest, the opportunity to reduce pressure on freshwater reserves by being able to use brackish water can make a substantial contribution to reducing the environmental footprint of agricultural production,\" they conclude.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the South African shrub that invaded Australia?",
    "text": "The scrubby harbor-side hills of a South African city recently revealed details of an historical event that transformed Australian coastlines. That event led to the arrival in Australia of a native South African shrub, bitou bush. The invader went on to become one of Australia's worst weeds, smothering coastal dune vegetation.          While bitou bush has been widespread along Australia's east coast for decades, the weed arrived in Western Australia relatively recently. The species (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies rotundata) was discovered in 2012 at Kwinana, a port and industrial area south of Perth. This new invasion required urgent attention.Knowing where a weed has come from is fundamental to managing it well. Understanding how plants are introduced to new regions can enable effective biosecurity measures to be put in place. Establishing a weed's origin also reveals where to look for its natural enemies, such as insects or fungi, that can be used as classical biological control agents.Our research set out to decipher how bitou bush originally entered Australia and then spread from east to west. We reveal how the chance of new bitou bush arrivals in Australia is low and better biological control is possible.Establishing relationships between populationsEarlier research on bitou bush established Australian populations went through \"genetic bottlenecks\", meaning only a few plants, seeds or parts of plants arrived to begin with. However, the work was unable to identify a population in South Africa that was a genetic match to the bitou bush found in Australia.

Batchelor, CSIRO, Author provided             Our new research took a more comprehensive approach to reveal plants from the South African port of East London were the likely source. Our findings suggested there was a single introduction of bitou bush to eastern Australia, with subsequent movement of material to establish the population in Western Australia more than a century later.Travel by ballastTo build confidence in our results, we scoured historical archives in Australia and South Africa for records that could support or refute these findings. Could we turn a plausible hypothesis into a feasible smoking gun?In the storage racks of the National Herbarium of New South Wales lies a pressed sheet of dried plant material. Collected in 1908, this sample\u2014later identified as bitou bush\u2014was from the port-side suburb of Stockton in Newcastle. Newspaper reports revealed Stockton's local government had been complaining for at least ten years about a weed threat from dry ballast, making it likely the introduction of bitou bush to Australia occurred even earlier.Dry ballast consists of sand, soil, rocks and other matter used to provide stability to wooden sailing ships that had to travel without a heavy cargo load. This material was usually quarried at the port of departure. At the time, an increasingly large area in Stockton was reclaimed land comprised of ship's ballast.We found historical shipping records that showed ships were regularly leaving the South African Port of East London after taking on dry ballast, then sailing directly to Newcastle to collect coal. Before taking on coal, these ships discharged their dry ballast onto the ballast field at Stockton. We found documents showing that in 1904, more than half the ballast arriving in Australia was dumped at Stockton.

Credit: Newcastle University and Ralph Snowball             Historical maps revealed a ballast quarry on the west side of the Port of East London. This quarry existed in 1902 and exposed remnants can still be seen today. Bitou bush can still be found across the vegetation-covered hillsides near the old quarry. Their seeds are therefore likely to have been contaminants in dry ballast.      To Newcastle and beyond!The arrival of bitou bush at Stockton was the beginning of a wider invasion of the eastern Australian coastline. The plants now cover 1,600 km from Victoria to Queensland.This spread included deliberate plantings for dune stabilization in the 1950s. Our molecular work revealed these dune plantings were enabled by the local collection of seed from a limited number of plants, rather than new material from South Africa or widely sourced seed.We were not able to conclusively identify the introduction pathway from New South Wales to Western Australia. However, contamination of steel shipments between Newcastle or Port Kembla and Kwinana, or landscape plantings for the companies involved, are considered most likely. Why does this matter?                Likely source location of bitou bush in and around the quarry at the Port of East London (circa 1920). Credit: East London Museum             The discovery of a potential source population and pathway into Australia for bitou bush reveals two avenues for improved invasive species management.First, it opens the door to improved biological control. Earlier ineffective agents were sourced in South Africa from populations distantly related to the material introduced into Australia. Many effective agents, particularly pathogens, are highly host specific. New surveys around East London could discover a more effective biological control agent.Second, the work has clarified the ongoing risk of new introductions following the same pathway. Thankfully the use of dry ballast ceased with the move to steel-hulled ships carrying wet ballast, although the latter has its own biosecurity concerns.More generally, the case of bitou bush in Australia highlights the problem of inadvertent outcomes from introducing plants, either accidentally or deliberately, without rigorous risk assessment. We must remain vigilant to the risk of introductions facilitated by global trade and maintain strict border biosecurity protocols. More information:Amanda M.

    "text": "If scientists want to find out how fast a population of bacteria grows, they often measure how their cell count changes over time. However, this method has a major flaw: it does not measure how fast the bacteria multiply or die. Yet these factors are very important for understanding ecological processes. That is why researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen have now taken a closer look at these processes during a spring bloom in the German Bight. In doing so, they challenge some previous dogmas.          The researchers around Jan Br\u00fcwer, Bernhard Fuchs and Rudolf Amann investigated the growth of bacteria during the spring bloom off Helgoland using various methods: With the microscope, they counted and identified not only the cells present, but also the frequency of cells that were currently dividing. This way, they were able to calculate how quickly different types of bacteria multiplied in their natural environment.\"We used modern microscopic methods to visualize and count dividing cells in thousands of images,\" explains Jan Br\u00fcwer, who conducted the study as part of his doctoral thesis. \"We made use of the fact that a dividing cell has to split its duplicated genome into its daughter cells. Thus, we were able to clearly identify these cells based on the DNA distribution in the cell.\" This enabled the researchers to determine the growth rates of individual groups of bacteria over longer periods of time.\"The results had some surprises in store for us,\" says group leader Bernhard Fuchs. \"For example, we found that the most common group of bacteria in the ocean, called SAR11, divides almost ten times faster than assumed.\" Moreover, in many cases the measured growth rates do not match the abundance of the respective bacteria in the water.\"If bacteria divide often but are not abundant, it suggests that they are a popular victim of predators or viruses,\" Br\u00fcwer explains. \"The timing of bacterial proliferation was also surprising: SAR11 bacteria frequently divided before the onset of the algal bloom in the North Sea. From where they took the required energy to do so is still a mystery.\"                Sunset over the island of Helgoland in the German Bight, where the researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology obtained their samples. Credit: Jan Br\u00fcwer / Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology             Not all bacterial groups behaved as unexpectedly as SAR11; for other groups, the results now collected were more in line with the researchers' expectations\u2014in their case, growth rates and cell numbers largely matched.Until now, it has been assumed that SAR11, which have very small cells, get by with little nutrients, do not divide very often and are eaten only rarely because of their small size. In contrast, other larger bacteria, for example the Bacteroidetes, are seen as popular food, multiplying quickly and disappearing just as quickly when predators and viruses get on their trail. The new study by Br\u00fcwer and his colleagues paints a very different picture.      \"Our results influence our understanding of element cycles, especially the carbon cycle, in the ocean,\" Br\u00fcwer says. \"The most abundant bacteria in the ocean, SAR11, are more active and divide faster than previously believed. This could mean that they need fewer nutrients and are a more popular food source for other organisms than suspected. Also, the general turnover of bacteria during algal blooms seems to be faster than we thought.\"\"This research was methodologically very demanding and it shows how much information you can draw from microscopy images,\" says Rudolf Amann, director at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology. \"I am very proud of the researchers involved for mastering this mammoth task and glad to have the privilege to work with them. The results achieved will trigger many exciting discussions about the ecological relationships during a spring bloom and in the ocean in general.\"The research is published in mSystems.

    "text": "Enzymes are the molecule factories in biological cells. However, which basic molecular building blocks they use to assemble target molecules is often unknown and difficult to measure. An international team including bioinformaticians from Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf (HHU) has now taken an important step forward in this regard: Their AI method predicts with a high degree of accuracy whether an enzyme can work with a specific substrate. They now present their results in the scientific journal Nature Communications.          Enzymes are important biocatalysts in all living cells: They facilitate chemical reactions, through which all molecules important for the organism are produced from basic substances (substrates). Most organisms possess thousands of different enzymes, with each one responsible for a very specific reaction. The collective function of all enzymes makes up the metabolism and thus provides the conditions for the life and survival of the organism.Even though genes which encode enzymes can easily be identified as such, the exact function of the resultant enzyme is unknown in the vast majority\u2014over 99%\u2014of cases. This is because experimental characterizations of their function\u2014i.e. which starting molecules a specific enzyme converts into which concrete end molecules\u2014is extremely time-consuming.Together with colleagues from Sweden and India, the research team headed by Professor Dr. Martin Lercher from the Computational Cell Biology research group at HHU has developed an AI-based method for predicting whether an enzyme can use a specific molecule as a substrate for the reaction it catalyzes.Professor Lercher says, \"The special feature of our ESP ('Enzyme Substrate Prediction') model is that we are not limited to individual, special enzymes and others closely related to them, as was the case with previous models. Our general model can work with any combination of an enzyme and more than 1,000 different substrates.\"Ph.D. student Alexander Kroll, lead author of the study, has developed a so-called Deep Learning model in which information about enzymes and substrates was encoded in mathematical structures known as numerical vectors. The vectors of around 18,000 experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs\u2014where the enzyme and substrate are known to work together\u2014were used as input to train the Deep Learning model.Alexander Kroll says, \"After training the model in this way, we then applied it to an independent test dataset where we already knew the correct answers. In 91% of cases, the model correctly predicted which substrates match which enzymes.\"This method offers a wide range of potential applications. In both drug research and biotechnology it is of great importance to know which substances can be converted by enzymes. Professor Lercher says, \"This will enable research and industry to narrow a large number of possible pairs down to the most promising, which they can then use for the enzymatic production of new drugs, chemicals or even biofuels.\"Kroll adds, \"It will also enable the creation of improved models to simulate the metabolism of cells. In addition, it will help us understand the physiology of various organisms\u2014from bacteria to people.\"Alongside Kroll and Lercher, Professor Dr. Martin Engqvist from the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Sahasra Ranjan from the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai were also involved in the study. Engqvist helped design the study, while Ranjan implemented the model which encodes the enzyme information fed into the overall model developed by Kroll.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the method that allows cloning of wheat rust resistance genes?",
    "text": "Researchers have cloned the wheat rust resistance genes Lr9 and Sr43 and identified that they encode unusual kinase fusion proteins. The research, published in Nature Genetics, will enable new options for addressing resistance to disease in bread wheat.          Each year about 20% of global wheat production is lost to pests and disease, the equivalent of 3,500 grain ships. Breeding resistant cultivars is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly ways to address the problem.The wild relatives of wheat provide a reservoir of genetic diversity for crop improvement. The Lr9 leaf rust resistance gene, for example, was originally identified in a wild goatgrass (Aegilops umbellulata). In a pioneering experiment conducted in the 1950s, Dr. Ernest Sears succeeded in transferring a tiny Lr9-carrying segment of an Aegilops chromosome into bread wheat, demonstrating that it is possible to stably cross small chromosome segments from distant wild relatives.Nearly 40% of the resistance genes found in bread wheat today have been crossed into wheat from wild relatives over the last 60 years. Wheat cultivars carrying Lr9 were released in the late 1960s, and Lr9 is still effective in many wheat growing areas. However, this type of breeding can lead to co-introduction of unfavorable versions of other genes from the wild relative, known as \"linkage drag.\"KAUST researcher Yajun Wang used long-read sequencing to sequence the genomes of an Lr9-containing bread wheat cultivar and Ae. umbellulata. Comparison of the two genomes allowed the full reconstruction of this historic translocation. \"We found that Lr9 had been introduced into wheat along with about 536 other genes from Aegilops umbellulata. Moreover, the process led to the deletion of a small fragment of the wheat genome containing 87 genes,\" says Wang.Similar to Lr9, the stem rust resistance gene Sr43 came from the wild tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum elongatum).Two teams led by Simon Krattinger and Brande Wulff cloned Lr9 and Sr43, respectively, by generating mutants and comparing their sequence to the parent genomes.Find out how KAUST scientists are addressing one of the worst diseases that affects wheat globally. Credit: \u00a9 2023 KAUST; Anastasia Serin.\"The cloned genes can now be used to engineer bread wheat lines without linkage drag. More importantly, the genes can be combined with other cloned rust resistance genes into multigene stacks to create lines with superior and more durable resistance,\" says Guotai Yu, lead researcher on the Sr43 project.To clone Lr9, Wang developed a novel method called MutIsoSeq based on sequencing mRNA rather than genomic DNA. It combines long-read sequencing of mRNA from wild-type parental lines and short-read mRNA sequencing of mutant plants to identify candidate genes. Compared to other gene-cloning methods based on DNA sequencing, MutIsoSeq allows cheaper and faster cloning of causal genes without tedious genetic mapping, and the method can be easily applied in any basic molecular biology lab.The cloning of Lr9 and Sr43 also revealed that the genes encode unusual kinase fusion proteins. Wheat kinases have recently emerged as a prominent new player involved in disease resistance in wheat and barley. The researchers combined large-scale mutational analysis and AlphaFold protein modeling to interpret the protein function.\"A kinase is a common enzyme that plays important roles in many cellular processes in both plants and animals, including in immunity,\" says Krattinger.\"Pathogens secrete proteins that sabotage host processes, subverting the host and causing disease. Our work suggests that the fusion of these proteins to kinases may allow the host to more easily detect the presence of pathogens and trigger defense responses,\" he adds.A peculiar feature of the Sr43 gene is that it does not provide good resistance at elevated temperatures.\"Having cloned Sr43, we can now start to unravel the molecular mechanism of its temperature sensitivity.

    "text": "Two hundred and fifty-two million years ago, Earth experienced a mass extinction so devastating that it's become known as \"the Great Dying.\" Massive volcanic eruptions triggered catastrophic climate change, killing off nine out of every ten species and eventually setting the stage for the dinosaurs. But the Great Dying was a long goodbye\u2014 the extinction event took place over the course of up to a million years at the end of the Permian period. During that time, the fossil record shows drama and upheaval as species fought to get a foothold in their changing environments. One animal that exemplifies this instability was a tiger-sized, saber-toothed creature called Inostrancevia: a new fossil discovery suggests that Inostrancevia migrated 7,000 miles across the supercontinent Pangaea, filling a gap in a faraway ecosystem that had lost its top predators, before going extinct itself.          \"All the big top predators in the late Permian in South Africa went extinct well before the end-Permian mass extinction. We learned that this vacancy in the niche was occupied, for a brief period, by Inostrancevia,\" says Pia Viglietti, a research scientist at the Field Museum in Chicago and a co-author of the new study in Current Biology.The prehistoric creature looked the part of \"top predator.\" \"Inostrancevia was a gorgonopsian, a group of proto-mammals that included the first saber-toothed predators on the planet,\" says Viglietti. It was about the size of a tiger and likely had skin like an elephant or a rhino; while vaguely reptilian in appearance, it was part of the group of animals that includes modern mammals.Prior to this new paper, Inostrancevia had only ever been found in Russia. But while examining the fossil record of South Africa's Karoo Basin, Viglietti's colleague Christian Kammerer identified the fossils of two large predatory animals that were different from those normally found in the region. \"The fossils themselves were quite unexpected,\" says Viglietti. It's not clear how they made it from what's now Russia, or how long it took them to cross Pangaea and arrive in what's now South Africa. But being far from home was just one element of what made the fossils special.                Inostrancevia fossils in the field. Credit: Jennifer Botha.             \"When we reviewed the ranges and ages of the other top predators normally found in the area, the rubidgeine gorgonopsians, with these Inostrancevia fossils, we found something quite exciting,\" she says. \"The local carnivores actually went extinct quite a bit before even the main extinction that we see in the Karoo\u2014 by the time the extinction begins in other animals, they're gone.\"The arrival of Inostrancevia from 7,000 miles away and its subsequent extinction indicates that these top predators were \"canaries in the coal mine\" for the larger extinction event to come.\"This shows that the South African Karoo Basin continues to produce critical data for understanding the most catastrophic mass extinction in Earth's history,\" says co-author Jennifer Botha, director of GENUS Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences and professor at the Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.                Paul October, a now retired field technician from Iziko South African Museum, with Inostrancevia fossils in the field. Credit: Jennifer Botha.             \"We have shown that the shift in which groups of animals occupied apex predator roles occurred four times over less than two million years around the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, which is unprecedented in the history of life on land. This underlines how extreme this crisis was, with even fundamental roles in ecosystems in extreme flux,\" said Christian Kammerer, the study's first author and a research curator of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and research associate at the Field Museum.The vulnerability of these top predators matches what we see today. \"Apex predators in modern environments tend to show high extinction risk, and tend to be among the first species that are locally extirpated due to human-mediated activities such as hunting or habitat destruction,\" says Kammerer. \"Think about wolves in Europe or tigers in Asia, species which tend to be slow to reproduce and grow and require large geographic areas to roam and hunt prey, and which are now absent from most of their historic ranges. We should expect that ancient apex predators would have had similar vulnerabilities, and would be among the species that first go extinct during mass extinction events.\"In addition to shedding new light on the extinction event that helped lead to the rise of the dinosaurs, Viglietti says that the study is important for what it can teach us about the ecological disasters the planet is currently experiencing.

Credit: Pia Viglietti.             \"It's always good to get a better understanding of how mass extinction events affect ecosystems, especially because the Permian is basically a parallel on what we're going through now,\" said Viglietti. \"We don't really have any modern analogs of what to expect with the mass extinction happening today, and the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event represents one of the best examples of what we could experience with our climate crisis and extinctions. I guess the only difference is, we know what to do and how to stop it from happening.\" More information:Christian F.

    "text": "The complex mating rituals of the Sydney funnel-web spider have now been described in detail for the first time, with sexual routines including leg and body vibrations and female lifting, filling a missing link in the study of spiders.          Compared to studies of more diverse and visual spiders such as jumping spiders, crab and wolf spiders and orb weavers, the intriguing courtship behavior and mating systems of the highly venomous, ground-dwelling Sydney funnel-web (Atrax robustus) have been described by German and Australian experts, including Flinders University ecologist Dr. Bruno Buzatto.\"While the high level of toxicity and development of anti-venom has seen the funnel-web studied in the past, little is actually known about its ecology,\" says Dr. Buzatto.\"This is the first reconstruction of mating behaviors in funnel-web spiders where the behavioral repertoire is difficult to document due to the concealed life in funnel-shaped webs that are built in soil and leaf-litter habitats.\"Starting with the male's elaborate display outside a female burrow, videos have been collected to describe male and female funnel-web behaviors in captivity inside and outside their burrows in a new article published in the Journal of Zoology.The study covers new ground on pre-copulatory courtship and sexual behaviors including the chase, leg and body displays and lunge before lifting the female ahead of final copulation to reproduce.\"Female Sydney funnel-web spiders appear to remain quiescent during mating but some copulations ended with the male being chased away by the female,\" says Dr. Buzatto, adding cannibalism in these spiders is rare and probably more likely in captivity rather than in the wild.

    "text": "Ants' brains are amazingly sophisticated organs that enable them to coordinate complex behavior patterns such as the organization of colonies. Now, a group of researchers led by Christian Gruber of MedUni Vienna's Institute of Pharmacology have developed a method that allows them to study ants' brain chemistry and gain insights into the insects' neurobiological processes. The findings could help to explain the evolution of social behavior in the animal kingdom, and shed light on the biochemistry of certain hormone systems that have developed similarly in both ants and humans.          For the study, the researchers used a combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) to map the three-dimensional distribution of neuropeptides in the brains of two ant species: the leafcutter ant (Atta sexdens) and the black garden ant (Lasius niger).Researchers from MedUni Vienna, the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen and the University of Bremen have developed the new method for studying social insects' brains, which measure only a few millimeters in size. In future, their approach could play a decisive role in research into fundamental neurobiological processes. The method integrates three-dimensional chemical data into a high-definition anatomical model, allowing for unbiased visualization of 3D neurochemistry in its particular anatomical environment.Published in the journal PNAS Nexus, the study showed that some ant peptides, such as the tachykinin-related peptides TK1 and TK4, are widely distributed in many areas of both species' brains, while other peptides, including myosuppressin, are only found in particular regions. The researchers also noticed differences between the two species\u2014a large number of peptides were found in the optic lobe of L. niger, but only one (an ITG-like peptide) was identified in the same region in A. sexdens.                New insights into the complex neurochemistry of ants. Credit: Vladimir Wrangel/Shutterstock             The key feature of the new method is that a correlative approach is used to analyze data. This means that 3D maps of the distribution of neuropeptides and 3D anatomical models are precisely collated, generating two maps that help to navigate the ants' brains.Each map contains different information, which is critical for studying organs with high plasticity, such as the brains of social insects, which are particularly hard to analyze due to the complex division of labor and caste system in ant colonies. Building on previous studies of MS imaging of neuropeptides in invertebrate model systems, this approach represents a promising method for studying fundamental neurobiological processes by visualizing distortion-free 3D neurochemistry in its own complex anatomical environment.\"These findings have the potential to fundamentally alter the way we study complex neurobiological processes. Our method opens up new perspectives when it comes to observing the brains of social insects more closely and better understanding the functioning of nervous systems where chemistry and anatomy are fully attuned,\" commented lead author Benedikt Geier, who worked alongside co-lead author Esther Gil Mansilla.\"In terms of neurobiology, ants are a model species. Due to the extremely complex structures in ant colonies, this method could be applied in future to gain an understanding of various factors, including the evolution of social behavior in the animal kingdom, or the biochemistry of certain hormone systems that have developed in a similar fashion in both ants and humans,\" reported Christian Gruber.

    "question_squad": " What is a GPCR?",
    "text": "Biosensors are artificial molecular complexes designed to detect the presence of target chemicals or even biomolecules. Consequently, biosensors have become important in diagnostics and synthetic cell biology. However, typical methods for engineering biosensors focus on optimizing the interactions between static binding surfaces, and current biosensor designs can only recognize structurally well-defined molecules, which can be too rigid for \"real-life\" biology.          \"We developed a novel computational approach for designing protein-peptide ligand binding and applied it to engineer cell-surface chemotactic receptors that reprogrammed cell migration,\" says EPFL professor Patrick Barth. \"We think that our work could broadly impact the design of protein binding and cell engineering applications.\"The new biosensors developed by Barth's group can sense flexible compounds and trigger complex cellular responses, which open up new possibilities for biosensor applications. The researchers created a computational framework, which is a computer-based system, for designing protein complexes that can change their shape and function dynamically\u2014as opposed to the conventional static approaches. The framework can look at previously unexplored protein sequences to come up with new ways for the protein's groups to be activated, even in ways that are different to their natural function.The researchers used their new method to create synthetic receptors that can sense and respond to multiple natural or engineered molecular signals, providing optimal sensing of flexible ligands and strong allosteric signaling responses, a term that refers to changes in protein activity when a molecule binds to a different site on a protein, causing a change in the protein's shape and activity at a different site. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.The designed receptors act by interacting with the flexible ligands via allosteric triggers, like natural receptors, but they improve and rearrange how the signals are transferred, a bit like dialing the same number from a different cell phone with better service. Specifically, the triggers seem to funnel signals through the same set of \"transmission hubs\" as the natural ones, but considerably enhance signal transmission through optimally rewired dynamic couplings.The research shows that combining a flexible sensing layer with a robust signal transmission layer may be a common hallmark of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of enormously important receptors in the cell, connected to virtually every major aspect of its life and function.\"We were able to leverage our biosensor design to drive cell migration in lymphocytes, which migrate more efficiently towards chemokines when equipped with designed biosensors,\" says Rob Jefferson, the study's first author. \"Chemokines serve as chemical beacons for immune cell recruitment in the body, a suboptimal process in certain diseases that could be improved with our biosensors.\"The new method of designing synthetic receptors could be useful in a wide variety of therapeutic contexts. For example, engineered cytotoxic lymphocytes with enhanced chemotaxis toward tumor sites could prove useful in cancer treatment. Designing receptors that can sense and respond to specific signals, provides a promising new synthetic cell biology tool, leading to more precise control over cellular processes for a wide range of therapeutic applications.

    "text": "Mammal evolution has been flipped on its head, according to new research that suggests marsupials are the more evolved mammals.          By estimating how the common ancestor of mammals reproduced and developed, scientists have turned over the longstanding belief that marsupials are more primitive than placentals.Marsupials have long been considered the intermediate step in evolution between egg-laying and placental mammals, because they give birth to highly underdeveloped young similar to an embryonic state for placentals.However, new research has revealed that the ancestor of both groups was more similar to placentals than to marsupials, meaning that marsupials have modified their method of reproduction more than placentals have.The study, published in Current Biology, analyzed skulls during different stages of development in 22 living mammal species. Micro-CT scans of 165 specimens helped the research team reconstruct the changes of the skull for these species during this early phase.Using this data, they estimated how the common ancestor of marsupials and placentals would have developed and compared it with both groups to see which was the most similar.Professor Anjali Goswami, a research leader at the Museum and senior author of the study, says, \"Using this big comparative data set generated from the museum's historical collections, we have been able to flip what we know about mammal evolution on its head.\"Using a huge dataset of micro-CT scans of marsupial and placental specimens ranging from embryos to adults, the team measured how their skull shape changes through development and reconstructed how their ancestor would have developed. This showed that marsupials have changed more from than ancestor than placentals have.\"For a long time, people have treated marsupials as 'lesser mammals,'\" which represent the intermediate stage between placental mammals and egg-layers, explains Anjali. \"It turns out that marsupials are the ones that are far more evolved from the ancestral form.\"\"As a member of the placental mammals, we often have this bias that ours is the group that evolution is directed towards, but that's not how evolution works.\"How did marsupial and placental mammals evolve?All mammals alive today can be divided into three groups: placental mammals, marsupials and monotremes. These are easily distinguished by their methods of reproduction.The largest group is the placental mammals, which give birth to live, well-developed young and comprise about 95% of all living mammals, including humans.Marsupials also give birth to live young but have a very short gestation period and so the offspring are very underdeveloped and so must be looked after by a parent in a pouch.Monotremes are egg-laying mammals and are the smallest of the three groups. It contains just five species alive today in two families: the platypus and the echidnas.It is thought that living mammals all descended from an egg-laying common ancestor that lived approximately 180 million years ago. The therians, which is the group containing marsupials and placental mammals, are thought to have diverged from each other quite soon after, around 160 million years ago.As the therians evolved away from young being born via an egg, it was originally thought that the live birth of an underdeveloped baby as in modern marsupials was the natural intermediate stage. However, this study found that this not to be the case.\"What we could clearly show is the marsupial way of developing is the one that's changed the most from the ancestor of marsupials and placentals,\" says Anjali.\"How marsupials reproduce isn't an intermediate form between egg-laying and placental mammals. It's just a completely different way of developing that marsupials have evolved.\"      Why do marsupials give birth to underdeveloped offspring?Placental mammals are born with their four limbs and skulls already well developed, which grow in size as the animal gets older. The gestation period ranges depending on body size but can be up to 22 months in African elephants.In contrast, marsupials are essentially born in an embryonic state. For example, the red kangaroo gives birth to a baby the size of a jellybean just a month after conception before nursing its young for up to six months.The hindlimbs and skull of these babies have not fully formed, but the forelimbs and mouth bones are a little more developed. Effectively, the animal has all the parts it needs to crawl through its mother's fur to reach the milk-giving teats and suckle, but not much else. Many marsupials have a pouch which helps to protect the underdeveloped young while they are in this very vulnerable stageBut why marsupials developed this reproductive strategy is still not fully understood.\"It's been suggested that the marsupial strategy is better if you're living with a lot of environmental instability,\" explains Anjali. \"Placental mammals have long gestation times so if an animal goes through a period where resources dry up, both mother and offspring would likely die because it's all internal.\"\"With a marsupial, it's a much lower risk strategy because the mother can easily abandon them at a very early developmental stage, so at least the mother can survive and try again later.\"While today around two-thirds of living marsupials are found in Australia, the earliest marsupials are thought to have originated in North America. From there, they spread down through South America and eventually made the journey to Australia via Antarctica using land connections.And yet many placental mammals also lived in South America during this time but seemingly did not manage to make that journey.\"One idea is that marsupials were better equipped to make this journey because of their more flexible reproductive system,\" explains Anjali.\"So by stretching out development and making it more external to the mother, marsupials may be able to cope better with less stable environmental situations. But this is very much a guess and a hypothesis that needs to be tested.\" More information:Heather E. White et al, Pedomorphosis in the ancestry of marsupial mammals, Current Biology (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the land-bound creatures endemic to Madagascar?",
    "text": "Three hundred miles off the southeastern coast of Africa, Madagascar is a land of mystery. There is such a rich diversity of vertebrates found only on the island that is so unlike anything seen elsewhere in the world that any evolutionary biologist has to wonder\u2014how did they get there and when?          Lemurs are only found here. A primate separated evolutionarily from apes and monkeys by more than 50 million years, lemurs have diversified into about 111 species, making up a third of all primate species in the world.The fossa, a distant cousin of the mongoose, is an apex island predator that has convergently evolved to have more cat-like traits and appearance, filling in the missing felines biome niche.Then there are the 36 species of tenrec, which can range in appearance from a tiny shrew-like mouse to a large tailless possum, hedgehog and mole lookalikes, filling out several convergent evolutionary niches usually held by more genetically diverse creatures.A pair of researchers at the University of Hong Kong in China and Temple University in Philadelphia decided to join the debate about just how the island became populated by so many unusual creatures. They detail their research findings in a paper, \"The colonisation of Madagascar by land-bound vertebrates,\" published in the journal Biological Reviews.Three basic ways are possible, with versions of each having been postulated in the past.Plate tectonics, meaning the land-bound creatures endemic to Madagascar evolved there, separated from the rest of the animal kingdom since the island split off from the ancient Gondwana supercontinent. Since this split began 170 million years ago, understanding when species evolved away from shared ancestors of other vertebrates eliminates all but a few of Madagascar's inhabitants from this possibility.Another is a land bridge spanning all or most of the way from Africa to Madagascar, allowing creatures to simply wander over. This might be aided by lower sea levels during ice ages or continental drift as land masses have moved over millions of years. As an example, all the marsupials of Australia walked there from South America when the two continents were further south and connected by Antarctica. However, the geologic record does not seem to support a period when the sea floor around Madagascar would be exposed, nor any string of islands above the surface to shorten the distance.      This leaves arrival by sea, floating, swimming or rafting on vegetation carried by the currents.The team looked for evidence to build arrival time windows for 26 of Madagascar's land vertebrate clades\u201416 reptiles, five mammals, and five amphibians. The approach was designed to highlight the method of arrival by reconstructing the temporal influx patterns. If species arrived together in a few windows of opportunity, it would suggest a land bridge was available. If instead the colonization events looked randomly dispersed through time, getting washed ashore by sea currents might be a better explanation.The resulting colonization maps appeared temporally random with no temporal concentrations.This places the biological signals in agreement with the leading geological evidence, as well as the taxonomic composition of the fauna, in supporting over-water dispersal as the mechanism that explains all but a few of Madagascar's land-vertebrate groups.The exception being podocnemid turtles and typhlopoid snakes, which the researchers believe have been on Madagascar since before it was an island. From here, they survived the extinction event that killed off the dinosaurs and watched as waves of hapless creatures washed up on the shores over millions of years of colonization events.Over-water dispersal would be by rafting on floating vegetation or otherwise staying afloat while drifting with the currents. One of the limiting factors is time at sea, even with a favorable sea current thought to exist 20 million years ago when Africa and Madagascar were further south, the voyage could take several weeks.The researchers note the preponderance of reptile clades over land-mammal and amphibian groups in Madagascan fauna. The reptile abundance is a characteristic common on islands and archipelagoes that were never connected to a continent and where over-water colonization is the only possible route. Reptiles are much more resistant to dehydration, the main obstacle in a long voyage by sea.The Madagascan mammals have something else in common with remote island mammals in other parts of the world. They all originate from small-bodied ancestors with low energy requirements and the ability to enter into torpor, a hibernation-like state of reduced metabolism, which may have allowed them to withstand the journey to new lands.

    "text": "Is it possible to extend lifespan by simply slowing the aging of an organ, such as the intestine? CNRS researchers have discovered how to extend the life expectancy of zebrafish by reactivating a gene within intestinal cells. The results were published in the journal Nature Aging on May 4, 2023.          The intestine plays a crucial role in an anti-aging approach as well as general health. Over a century ago, Elie Metchnikov observed that aging ensued from increased inflammation of the intestine and microbial infiltration within blood circulation. The more we age, the less the digestive tract serves as a barrier, allowing the undesirable particles and bacteria that cause the more rapid aging of the organism to pass through.In a new study, Miguel Godinho Ferreira and his team at the Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging (Ircan) in Nice (CNRS/Inserm/Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur) have studied the impact on aging of telomere length in the intestinal cells of zebrafish. As with humans, these chromosome extremities shrink faster in the intestine than in other organs during the course of a life, which is why this process plays such an important role in aging.Scientists inserted a DNA fragment within zebrafish that enabled intestinal cells to produce the enzyme responsible for lengthening telomeres, telomerase. They then observed the slowing not only of the organ's decline, but also and especially that of the entire organism. This phenomenon regenerates the fertility and general health of individuals during the normal aging process, and increases lifespan with no associated risk of developing cancer.The proximity between telomere length among zebrafish and humans opens prospects for counteracting aging. Researchers are simultaneously studying the pathologies associated with shrinking telomere length, including cancer as well as neurodegenerative, immune, and gastrointestinal diseases.

    "text": "Extreme weather caused by climate change has damaged food production across Europe.          Confronted with a deteriorating situation, divided European Union decision-makers are debating new rules for genetically modified crops.Last year's drought ravaged the continent's farms, starving everything from Spanish olive harvests to Hungary's maize and sunflower crops, Italian and Romanian corn fields to France's dairy production.Some argue the answer to Europe's problems is deregulating gene modification techniques to produce better crops. Others claim this would be a \"smokescreen\" to avoid having to radically change the way the bloc farms.Supporters say seeds produced using gene editing techniques are less vulnerable to drought and disease\u2014and require less water.The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will propose a law in July that will loosen the rules on plants produced by certain new genomic techniques (NGTs), branded by critics as simply \"new genetically modified organisms (GMOs)\".The proposals will open a new battlefront among the EU's 27 member states\u2014with drought-hit countries especially in favor\u2014and between EU lawmakers.The new techniques are a mix of genomic editing tools that alter a plant's genetic make-up without the addition of foreign genetic material, unlike \"transgenic\" GMOs that include DNA from other species.The commission says the current rules on GMOs including permission and labeling are \"not fit for purpose\" for the new technology.\"Plants produced by new genomic techniques can support sustainability,\" the EU's health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, said last month.The proposals, she said, \"will strongly signal to farmers, researchers and industry that this is the way forward in the EU\".'Magnificent tool'In a document from February seen by AFP, the commission looked at whether it should treat traditional seeds and those produced using the new techniques, with modifications that could in theory have happened naturally, as the same.France, severely affected by drought last summer, backs changing the rules.In April, French Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau expressed his concerns over what he called Europe's \"delay\", arguing there should be a push to allow biotechnology that gives Europe the tools to deal with climate change by producing more resistant seeds.Late last year, his Spanish counterpart, Luis Planas, hailed the techniques as a \"magnificent tool to have seeds that need less water and fertiliser\".Other countries are more wary.In March, Austria criticized a commission study that it claimed was based on \"assumptions\" rather than scientific data and called for a comprehensive analysis of any environmental and health risks.Cyprus, Germany, Hungary and Luxembourg support that position.The powerful European farming lobby group Copa-Cogeca supports the new rules.\"If we need to supply society with food in Europe, and if we want to be self-sufficient, then we need to adapt rules,\" said Thor Gunnar Kofoed, chair of the seed working group at Copa-Cogeca.      Parliament dividedA majority of EU lawmakers support relaxing the rules.The European Parliament's biggest political group, the conservative European People's Party (EPP), opposes any binding target to cut pesticides but pushes for new rules on the \"innovative\" technology that would \"stimulate research, investment and jobs\".Pascal Canfin, a French centrist MEP and the chairman of the parliament's environment committee, said the new biotechnology could \"be part of the useful solutions for the agricultural transition\" if they help avoid using chemical pesticides.But unlike the EPP, he supports a cap on pesticides.Left-wing parties in the EU parliament are resisting specific laws for NGTs, insisting that the new technology already comes under current wide-ranging rules on GMOs.The forthcoming battle over the draft law, which will have to be negotiated between the member states and parliament, is likely to focus on safeguards.The Greens want a full risk assessment to avoid unintended effects and force producers to ensure detection and traceability methods, and make labeling compulsory.Labeling would put off consumers who prefer GMO-free food, said Mute Schimpf, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, who criticized the reform.\"This proposal is a smokescreen to avoid the debate we should have on shifting to a truly sustainable farming system,\" she told AFP.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:EU's next food fight: regulating gene-edited crops (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-eu-food-gene-edited-crops.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "A new article published in the Journal of Animal Ecology suggests that current measures to protect grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are damaging the ecosystem and should be stopped.          The existing policy, introduced in 2000, calls for the eradication of small burrowing mammals. These include the mountain-dwelling herbivores, the plateau pika, and another small rodent, the zokor. Both are keystone species and are known as ecosystem engineers due to their modification of and impact on the environment.The report's authors say that the current extermination programs are not based on studies that considered the full effects of culling these rodents.\"The government agency's policy of conducting large-scale animal culling campaigns each year is not a good approach,\" says Professor Johannes Knops from the Health and Environmental Sciences department at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and corresponding author.Professor Knops and the first author, Dr. Wenjin Li from the College of Ecology at Lanzhou University, propose replacing the eradication policy with a nature-based control strategy.\"Our research shows that using natural predators and other ecological factors to regulate burrowing mammal populations can be a more sustainable and effective approach to grassland management.\"The study has important implications for grassland management practices worldwide. Small burrowing mammals are common in grasslands, and their eradication can negatively impact ecosystem health and productivity.                Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, yak herders summer camp. Yak graze widely during the day and are brought back to the camp in the evening for milking. Credit: J. Knops and XJTLU             A balancing actThe Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau grasslands play a crucial role in the quality of water flowing into major Asian rivers, including the Yangtze, Yellow, Lancang-Mekong, Indus and Ganges. Grassland degradation can also increase the chance of flooding events.The campaign to permanently eradicate plateau pikas and zokors is part of Chinese government agencies' efforts to protect the grasslands.The policy is part of a nationwide initiative, the Returning Grazing Land to Grassland project, and is based on the assumption that the rodents cause damage to grasslands by consuming foliage and therefore compete with grazing livestock for food, and cause soil erosion.However, the new study discusses the irrationality and consequences of this policy and reports that small burrowing mammals can actually help to prevent grassland degradation.Professor Knops says, \"If we look at the grasslands, we will find numerous plant species, and not all animals eat the same plants, so it is crucial to consider the entire food chain rather than killing all the small mammals.\"The authors also say that burrowing animals can increase plant diversity as they increase seed dispersion and light availability by consuming taller grasses. Their burrows provide refuges and habitats for other species and can help to decrease surface water runoff and soil erosion.                The research team conducting experiments on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Credit: Wenjin Li and Lanzhou University             The researchers advise that the eradication policy needs to be reconsidered and revoked, as small burrowing mammals play crucial ecological roles in grassland management. They say that diminishing the rodent population disrupts ecosystem processes and reduces biodiversity.The research also suggests that the current poisoning method used to eradicate small burrowing mammals has several overlooked adverse effects.      Collateral damageIn the paper, the authors discuss the potential unintended consequences of using the high-cost and labor-intensive poisoning method to kill small mammals in grasslands. These include the development of resistance to poisons by target species and potential harm to non-target species.Additionally, this policy can increase human-wildlife conflict by reducing natural predator populations and creating imbalances in the ecosystem.Professor Knops explains, \"It's important to consider the knock-on effects of reducing the small burrowing mammal population. If there are fewer small mammals, there is less food for their natural predators, such as red foxes, steppe polecats, upland buzzards, brown bears and mountain weasels.\"Not only will these larger mammals start to look for alternative food sources and increasingly prey on livestock, causing more human-wildlife conflict, but their populations will also decrease.                Yak livestock returning from grazing to be milked. Credit: J. Knops and XJTLU             \"The eradication policy, therefore, causes the opposite effect to the one intended, as when the number of the pika and zokor's natural predators is reduced, burrowing mammal populations can increase rapidly.\"This then requires more human control, which is costly and negatively impacts non-target species and the environment.\"Rethinking control The researchers suggest the goal to control burrowing mammal populations should not be totally eradicated but can be regulated with a nature-based control strategy that uses natural predators and other environmental factors such as their preferred plant species and the height of vegetation.The report proposes measures such as providing nesting spaces for raptors and reducing the over-grazing of livestock on the grasslands. This allows the grass to grow and keeps the small mammal population at a manageable level, as they prefer shorter vegetation.The authors argue that this approach is more effective and sustainable for long-term grassland management than traditional methods that rely heavily on human intervention and poisoning.Professor Knops says, \"By maintaining a stable, low density of burrowing mammals using natural predators and ecological factors, we can promote sustainable livestock grazing practices while also preserving biodiversity and reducing human-wildlife conflicts.\"Further research is needed to refine this approach and test its effectiveness in various grassland ecosystems. Still, the study's findings offer important insights into the ecological roles of small burrowing mammals in grasslands and how their presence can benefit ecosystem health and productivity.

    "text": "How old are butterflies, and where did they evolve? And perhaps more importantly, how and when did they reach the isolated continent of Australia?          Answers to these simple questions have baffled scientists for decades. Until recently we had very little idea when butterflies evolved, and hypotheses concerning their place of origin were largely educated guesses.In recent years, however, several studies have indicated butterflies most likely arose sometime during the Cretaceous period, when dinosaurs dominated the Earth. Now, an international collaboration (of which I am a member) has placed the time of origin much more precisely: 101.4 million years ago, give or take 1.2 million years.These early butterflies were different from nocturnal moths, their ancestors. They flew during the day, rather than at night, and were attracted to brightly colored flowers for their rich nectar.A 100-million-year history To reach this conclusion, researchers from dozens of countries needed to construct the world's largest \"family tree\" of butterfly species. This tree of life was assembled with DNA from 2,244 species representing all butterfly families and 92% of genera.                The \u2018family tree\u2019 of butterfly species was pieced together using DNA from 2,244 species. Credit: Kawahara et al. / Nature Ecology & Evolution, CC BY There are roughly 19,000 butterfly species in the world, and piecing together the 100-million-year history of the group required assembling the world's largest dataset of butterfly DNA sequences, geographical distributions and larval host plants.Underlying the analysis were 11 rare butterfly fossils, without which the analysis would have been impossible. Butterflies are rarely preserved in the fossil record, and those that are preserved are frequently difficult to identify.These fossils served as calibration points on the evolutionary tree. Once the tree was calibrated researchers could then estimate the timing of key events in butterfly evolution, starting with their origin.North American origins Not only did this latest study determine the age of butterflies, it also discovered where the butterflies first originated. By assembling a database of the distributions of all modern species and the plants on which they lay their eggs, the scientists were able to trace the movements of butterflies through time and space.                The Regent Skipper butterfly (Euschemon rafflesia), found only in the rainforests of Australia\u2019s east coast, is the last remaining species of the Euschemoniinae subfamily. Credit: MF Braby, Author provided             The study tells a dynamic story\u2014one rife with rapid diversifications, faltering advances, and improbable dispersals. Some groups traveled over what seem impossibly vast distances, and others seem to have stayed in one place while continents, mountains and rivers moved around them.According to this latest research, butterflies first appeared somewhere in Central and western North America.At that time in the mid-Cretaceous, the continent of North America was part of eastern Laurasia, and it was bisected by an expansive seaway that split the continent in two. Present-day Mexico was joined in a long arc with what is now the United States, Canada and Russia.North and South America had not yet joined via the isthmus of Panama, but butterflies seem to have had little difficulty crossing the water gap into the Southern Hemisphere. Once they reached South America, the early butterflies diversified to an astonishing degree.From there, many groups not only moved back into North America, but they also dispersed to Australia via Antarctica. At the time, the three continents were still connected to form Southern Gondwana, a remnant of the supercontinent Gondwana.                Credit: The Conversation             The path to Australia\u2014and the rest of the world Two of the earliest butterfly lineages to reach Australia via Antarctica were the subfamilies Coeliadinae (awl skipper butterflies) (around 72 million years ago) and Euschemoniinae (around 65 million years ago). The Euschemoniinae are a group of butterflies found only in Australia, containing just a single remaining species\u2014the spectacular regent skipper (Euschemon rafflesia)\u2014restricted to the rainforests along the east coast.To reach Australia, butterflies must have once lived in Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene periods when global temperatures were considerably warmer than today. They would have made their way across the continent to Australia before the two landmasses separated some 34 million years ago.Other groups of butterflies entered Australia much later via the islands of South-East Asia. They had earlier reached Asia from North America across the Bering land bridge.From there, they quickly covered ground, spreading and diversifying across Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. They even made their way to India, which was then an isolated island, separated by kilometers of open sea on all sides.Once butterflies had become established in Central and North America approximately 101 million years ago, they quickly diversified alongside their plant hosts over the next 25 million years, with the last two families (Riodinidae and Lycaenidae) evolving around 76 million years ago. By the time dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago, all six modern butterfly families had arrived on the scene.

    "question_squad": " What is the term for DNA that an organism sheds into the environment?",
    "text": "Human DNA can be sequenced from small amounts of water, sand and air in the environment to potentially extract identifiable information like genetic lineage, gender, and health risks, according to our new research.          Every cell of the body contains DNA. Because each person has a unique genetic code, DNA can be used to identify individual people. Typically, medical practitioners and researchers obtain human DNA through direct sampling, such as blood tests, swabs or biopsies. However, all living things, including animals, plants and microbes, constantly shed DNA. The water, soil and even the air contain microscopic particles of biological material from living organisms.DNA that an organism has shed into the environment is known as environmental DNA, or eDNA. For the last couple of decades, scientists have been able to collect and sequence eDNA from soil or water samples to monitor biodiversity, wildlife populations and disease-causing pathogens. Tracking rare or elusive endangered species through their eDNA has been a boon to researchers, since traditional monitoring methods such as observation or trapping can be difficult, often unsuccessful and intrusive to the species of interest.Researchers using eDNA tools usually focus only on the species they're studying and disregard DNA from other species. However, humans also shed, cough and flush DNA into their surrounding environment. And as our team of geneticists, ecologists and marine biologists in the Duffy Lab at the University of Florida found, signs of human life can be found everywhere but in the most isolated locations.The authors and their colleagues use environmental DNA to study sea turtles.Animals, humans and viruses in eDNAOur team uses environmental DNA to study endangered sea turtles and the viral tumors to which they are susceptible. Tiny hatchling sea turtles shed DNA as they crawl along the beach on their way to the ocean shortly after they are born. Sand scooped from their tracks contains enough DNA to provide valuable insights into the turtles and the chelonid herpesviruses and fibropapillomatosis tumors that afflict them. Scooping a liter of water from the tank of a recovering sea turtle under veterinary care equally provides a wealth of genetic information for research. Unlike blood or skin sampling, collecting eDNA causes no stress to the animal.Genetic sequencing technology used to decode DNA has improved rapidly in recent years, and it is now possible to easily sequence the DNA of every organism in a sample from the environment. Our team suspected that the sand and water samples we were using to study sea turtles would also contain DNA from a number of other species\u2014including, of course, humans. What we didn't know was just how informative the human DNA we could extract would be.To figure this out, we took samples from a variety of locations in Florida, including the ocean and rivers in urban and rural areas, sand from isolated beaches and a remote island never usually visited by people. We found human DNA in all of those locations except the remote island, and these samples were high quality enough for analysis and sequencing.We also tested the technique in Ireland, tracing along a river that winds from a remote mountaintop, through small rural villages and into the sea at a larger town of 13,000 inhabitants. We found human DNA everywhere but in the remote mountain tributary where the river starts, far from human habitation.We also collected air samples from a room in our wildlife veterinary hospital in Florida. People who were present in the room gave us permission to take samples from the air. We recovered DNA matching the people, the animal patient and common animal viruses present at the time of collection.                Human eDNA can be collected and analyzed from a variety of sources. Credit: Liam Whitmore/Created with BioRender.com, CC BY-NC-ND Surprisingly, the human eDNA found in the local environment was intact enough for us to identify mutations associated with disease and to determine the genetic ancestry of people who live in the area. Sequencing DNA that volunteers left in their footprints in the sand even yielded part of their sex chromosomes.      Ethical implications of collecting human eDNAOur team dubs inadvertent retrieval of human DNA from environmental samples \"human genetic bycatch.\" We're calling for deeper discussion about how to ethically handle human environmental DNA.Human eDNA could present significant advances to research in fields as diverse as conservation, epidemiology, forensics and farming. If handled correctly, human eDNA could help archaeologists track down undiscovered ancient human settlements, allow biologists to monitor cancer mutations in a given population or provide law enforcement agencies useful forensic information.However, there are also myriad ethical implications relating to the inadvertent or deliberate collection and analysis of human genetic bycatch. Identifiable information can be extracted from eDNA, and accessing this level of detail about individuals or populations comes with responsibilities relating to consent and confidentiality.                The researchers extracted identifiable genetic information from footprints in the sand. Credit: David Duffy, CC BY-ND While we conducted our study with the approval of our institutional review board, which ensures that studies on people adhere to ethical research guidelines, there is no guarantee that everyone will treat this type of information ethically.Many questions arise regarding human environmental DNA. For instance, who should have access to human eDNA sequences? Should this information be made publicly available? Should consent be required before taking human eDNA samples, and from whom? Should researchers remove human genetic information from samples originally collected to identify other species?We believe it is vital to implement regulations that ensure collection, analysis and data storage are carried out ethically and appropriately. Policymakers, scientific communities and other stakeholders need to take human eDNA collection seriously and balance consent and privacy against the possible benefits of studying eDNA. Raising these questions now can help ensure everyone is aware of the capabilities of eDNA and provide more time to develop protocols and regulations to ensure appropriate use of eDNA techniques and the ethical handling of human genetic bycatch.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the parasitic fungus that can manipulate the behavior of fruit flies?",
    "text": "In a new study published in eLife, lead author Carolyn Elya, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, reveals the molecular and cellular underpinnings behind the parasitic fungus, Entomophthora muscae's (E. muscae), ability to manipulate the behavior of fruit flies.          Elya first described the manipulated behavior, called summiting, in a study published in eLife in 2018. Elya, who was studying microbes carried by fruit flies while a graduate student at University of California (UC) Berkeley, set out rotting fruit to capture wild fruit flies.When she later checked to see is she had captured any, she found instead zombie flies, with a banding pattern on their abdomen, that had died striking an interesting pose. Through extraction and sequencing of DNA Elya confirmed the suspected cause, E. muscae.Summiting occurs at sunset when the infected flies climb to an elevated location and extend their proboscises to the surface. A sticky droplet that emerges from the proboscis adheres the fly to the surface right before the wings raise up and away from the body and the flies die.\"The climbing is very important as it positions the fly in an advantageous location for the fungus to spread to the most possible hosts,\" says Elya. \"The fungus jumps to the new host by forming very specialized and temporary structures that burst through the fly's skin and shoots spores into the environment that are only good for a handful of hours. It's a fleeting process, so an advantageous position is everything to survival.\"                Zombie flies strike their final pose adhered to a wooden dowel. Credit: Carolyn Elya             While at UC Berkeley, Elya developed a laboratory model she refers to as the Entomophthora muscae-Drosophila melanogaster 'zombie fly' system using the wild fungal isolate she found in her backyard. With this system, Elya could continuously infect fruit flies\u2014a laboratory staple, as well as culture the fungus independently of the fly host in media thought to mimic the internal environment of the fly.Summiting has appeared several times in scientific literature, but studies had only been observations of dead house flies. No one had ever observed how flies behave in their last hours of life. Elya set out to fill this knowledge gap of what happens when flies summit by developing a high-throughput behavioral assay to automatically track hundreds of infected flies. While using this platform to monitor the behavior of flies becoming zombies, she encountered a surprise.      \"We found that summiting is not about climbing,\" said Elya, \"it's actually this burst of locomotor activity that starts about two and a half hours before the flies die.\"With this discovery, Elya and co-authors paired her system to create on-demand zombie flies with the lab's powerful fruit fly genetic toolkit. With these and the author's new behavior assay they could identify genes and neurons required for flies to summit.\"Overall, we found the flies hormonal axes was mediating summiting behavior. When we silenced these neurons the flies were really bad at summiting,\" Elya says. These neurons send projections to a neurohemal organ that produces juvenile hormone, a hormone conserved in insects. \"We think the fungus is actually driving the activity of these neurons in order to drive the release of this hormone, which is causing the flies to have this burst of locomotor activity.\"                Zombie flies strike their final pose at the top of a vial. Credit: Carolyn Elya             Elya and co-authors were then able to collect a behavioral dataset consisting of hundreds of infected flies, which they then used to train a computer to identify flies as they are summiting. This classifier tool enabled the team to discover that fungal cells invade the fly's brains in an organized way, occupying specific regions of the brain during summiting.Interestingly, the team also discovered that the flies blood brain barrier is compromised when exposed to the fungus. Normally the neurons are protected from the blood that's circulating through the fly's body. The breakdown of the blood brain barrier has important consequences for what the neurons are being exposed to, potentially allowing  things that are circulating in the blood to interact with neurons in the brain, thus providing a route for modulating neural activity.\"We think this could be important for the way that the fungus is driving behavioral changes,\" Elya said, \"and we actually found that you can pull blood from flies that are doing the summiting behavior, put it into naive flies and drive some of this increased locomotion. So we've shown that there's at least the partial ability to recapitulate this summiting behavior just by transferring fly blood.\"Elya says that these experiments show some blood-borne factors can drive summiting behavior, though it's not yet clear what the identity of these factors are or who produces them (the fungus or the fly).Elya hopes to next develop transgenics to help modulate things from the fungus side in addition to perturbations that can already be made in the flies. \"There are still a lot of open questions here,\" she says, \"what the fungus is doing is still a mystery.\" More information:Carolyn Elya et al, Neural mechanisms of parasite-induced summiting behavior in 'zombie' Drosophila, eLife (2023).

    "text": "Polygenic scores\u2014estimates of an individual's predisposition for complex traits and diseases\u2014hold promise for identifying patients at risk of disease and guiding early, personalized treatments, but UCLA experts found the scores fail to account for the wide range of genetic diversity across individuals in all ancestries.          \"Polygenic scores can estimate the likelihood of an individual having a certain trait by pulling together and analyzing the small effects of thousands to millions of common genetic variants into a single score, but their performance among individuals from diverse genetic backgrounds is limited,\" said Bogdan Pasaniuc, Ph.D., a UCLA Health expert in statistical and computational methods for understanding genetic risk factors for common diseases.The researchers' analysis, published in Nature, shows that the accuracy of polygenic scores (PGSs) varies between individuals across a continuum of genetic ancestry\u2014and this is true even in populations that are traditionally considered as \"homogeneous,\" (e.g., Europeans) said Pasaniuc, the paper's senior author.Assessing PGS performance has commonly been done at the \"population\" level, such as in \"Europeans,\" clumping individuals of similar ancestries in a genetic-ancestry cluster, the authors said.\"Imposing artificial boundaries onto this continuum and ignoring the diversity, or 'heterogeneity,' within clusters can obscure variation within a group, conceal the similarities that may exist in individuals in different groups, and leave out individuals who do not fit neatly into a particular genetic ancestry,\" said Yi Ding, a graduate student in bioinformatics at UCLA, a member of the Pasaniuc Lab, and the paper's first author.To provide a more precise estimate of PGS accuracy, the researchers developed a method to evaluate PGS accuracy at the individual level. To test it, they applied PGSs for 84 complex traits to data from more than 35,000 individuals in the UCLA ATLAS Precision Health Biobank, one of the most diverse biobanks in the world, in part because the Los Angeles area is home to one of the most ancestrally diverse populations globally.      The new tool's \"training\" data came from a subset of individuals in the UK Biobank in the United Kingdom. As a substitute for discrete genetic ancestries, a continuous metric of \"genetic distance\" was used to establish the position of each individual in the ATLAS database on the genetic-ancestry continuum, essentially showing how similar or dissimilar a target (ATLAS) individual's genome was to that from the UK training population.\"We found that the more dissimilar\u2014or genetically 'distant'\u2014a target individual's genome was from the UK Biobank training data, the lower the accuracy of the PGS,\" Ding said.The accuracy of PGSs declined as genetic distance became greater even when the researchers looked specifically at genetic-ancestry groupings that have been considered homogeneous, such as among individuals of European genetic ancestries. Conversely, some individuals not identified with European ancestry could have higher levels of genetic similarity, showing that PGS performance could differ between two individuals from the same ancestry but be comparable for two people from different ancestries\u2014depending on their genetic similarity.\"Our genetic-distance metric outperformed discrete clustering in identifying individuals who could benefit from PGSs,\" said Pasaniuc, a researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the UCLA Health Institute for Precision Health.The research team identified several factors\u2014subjects for ongoing and future studies\u2014that could impact PGS accuracy and usefulness, especially in people with \"admixed\" ancestries. These are usually defined as individuals with recent ancestry from two or more continental sources\u2014such as African Americans and Latinos.Pasaniuc, whose research focuses on improving genetic risk factor predictions for people with admixed ancestry, said these individuals have \"mosaic\" genomes, with segments of different continental ancestries at every region. With different portions contributed by different ancestries, it is extremely difficult to accurately classify these individuals using conventional ancestry labels.\"For PGSs to be equitably used,\" he said, \"the assessment of PGS accuracy should account for the full spectrum of genetic diversity.\" More information:Yi Ding et al, Polygenic scoring accuracy varies across the genetic ancestry continuum, Nature (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the research group that has developed a method to identify the differences in genetic information?",
    "text": "Plants show enormous variety in traits relevant to breeding, such as plant height, yield and resistance to pests. One of the greatest challenges in modern plant research is to identify the differences in genetic information that are responsible for this variation.          A research team led by the \"Crop Yield\" working group at the Institute for Molecular Physiology at Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf (HHU) and the Carnegie Institution of Science at Stanford has now developed a method to identify precisely these special differences in genetic information.Using the example of maize, they demonstrate the great potential of their method in the journal Genome Biology and present regions in the maize genome that may help to increase yields and resistance to pests during breeding.The blueprint of all organisms is encoded in their DNA. This includes the genes that encode the proteins and determine an organism's inherent characteristics. In addition, there are other important sections of the DNA, in particular the regions that control the regulation of genes, i.e. when, under which conditions and to what extent the genes are activated.Compared to the genes, however, these regulatory regions\u2014also known as \"cis elements\"\u2014are difficult to find. Changes in precisely these DNA elements are largely responsible for the differences between organisms\u2014and thus also between different plant varieties.In the past few decades, researchers have discovered that the regulatory regions are the binding sites of specific proteins. Known as transcription factors, they determine when and for how long genes are activated.Co-corresponding author Dr. Thomas Hartwig, who heads the Crop Yield research group at HHU's Institute for Molecular Physiology and the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ) in Cologne explains, \"Finding the few variations that are key to changing traits such as pest resistance among the millions and millions of non-causative genome differences is the ultimate search for a needle in a haystack.\"\"Unlike protein-coding genes, regulatory sites usually cannot be identified based on the sequence alone. This makes them very difficult to pinpoint. Our method uses hybrid plants to measure the direct effects of variation in DNA sequence on transcription factor binding,\" says lead author Professor Dr. Zhi-Yong Wang from the Carnegie Institution for Science.      The study was developed in a cooperation with researchers from the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK) in Gatersleben as well as from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Iowa State University, U.S..Using hybrids, i.e., the first generation of plants created by crossbreeding two varieties, the research team can compare which regulatory regions differ across the entire genome. Co-author Dr. Julia Engelhorn says, \"Our analytical method allows us to measure precisely whether transcription factors bind more to the maternal or paternal genome.\" This procedure has also enabled the team to identify thousands of differences associated with traits, such as yield and pest resistance in maize.The technology was demonstrated for a transcription factor in the brassinosteroid pathway, a hormone related to growth and disease. Institute director Professor Dr. Wolf B. Frommer says, \"The team has identified thousands of genomic variations that can explain why one variety of maize behaves differently in terms of its yield or resistance to disease. Moreover, the team was able to show that these differences are almost equally genetic and epigenetic.\" The latter describes processes that influence gene activity without being encoded in the DNA sequence itself.One central result of the study is a list of more than 6,000 genome regions that can be targeted for plant breeding. These may include, regions through which positive traits are expressed in certain maize varieties that others plants lack.Hartwig says, \"Knowing where in the genome modern breeding methods can be applied to transfer characteristics from certain varieties to others is of great importance to biotechnology. Our study may serve as a guide on how to find these interesting genome regions.\"Professor Frommer adds, \"The study findings lay the foundation for using modern techniques to cultivate new varieties of maize by skillfully combining the optimal variants.\" More information:Thomas Hartwig et al, Hybrid allele-specific ChIP-seq analysis identifies variation in brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factor binding linked to traits in maize, Genome Biology (2023).

    "text": "The brush-tailed bettong\u2014a rare, very cute marsupial resembling a rabbit-sized kangaroo\u2014is bouncing back on the South Australian mainland, more than 100 years after disappearing from the region.          Bettongs, which leap with their hindlegs much like a full-sized kangaroo, populated over 60 percent of Australia before falling victim to cats, foxes and land-clearing after European settlement more than two centuries ago.Now they are making a comeback in South Australia's Yorke Peninsula, after wildlife scientists released 120 of the animals over a two-year period to see if they could survive outside of predator-proof enclosures or islands.New monitoring shows they are thriving, researchers said Friday.Scientists said they had trapped 85 brush-tailed bettongs, finding that 40 percent of them were new animals born in the peninsula and 42 of the 45 females had young in their pouches.\"It's fantastic to see so many new animals in the population,\" said Derek Sandow, ecologist for the Northern and Yorke Landscape Board.The furry creatures\u2014their numbers down from tens of millions pre-colonization to an estimated 12,000 to 18,000 now\u2014have clung to existence on Australian islands, in protected enclosures, and in a few pockets of Western Australia.'Mini-kangaroo on steroids'Their comeback in South Australia was helped by an intensive cat and fox control program, Sandow said, as well as a \"leaky\" fence to reduce\u2014without entirely excluding\u2014the predators from the southern part of the peninsula.The little animals play a big role in Australia's environment, he told AFP.\"They're a little, ankle-sized kangaroo, a mini kangaroo on steroids if you like. They've got really powerful hind legs, they carry their young in their pouch, like a kangaroo does, but they're only a kilo and a half (three pounds),\" Sandow explained.                Bettongs, which leap with their hindlegs much like a full-sized kangaroo, populated over 60 percent of Australia before falling victim to cats, foxes and land-clearing after European settlement more than two centuries ago.             \"So they're only small, but they'll shoot around in the bush, they'll create their little nests underneath in dense vegetation,\" he said.\"They dig a lot. A little bettong can move tons of soil per year. So they dig in the ground, they create little micro habitats for water infiltration for seeds to establish. And so they're just really important in the ecosystem.\"Since their numbers were decimated by cats and foxes, no other creature had been able to replicate their role in making the Australian landscape habitable for other wildlife, he said.Under attack, female brush-tailed bettongs have an unusual but effective defense mechanism, Sandow said.\"To get away, they'll kind of zigzag off through the bush at high speed. They're really fast for their size,\" the scientist said.      'Horrible parenting'But females had an extra defense mechanism\u2014throwing out their young from their pouches in the hope of escaping while the predator targets their offspring.\"It sounds like horrible parenting, but it's really successful,\" Sandow said.They breed quickly, he said, and females often have embryos ready to advance into the pouch when their young leave naturally or die.\"They can basically have their baby ready to go in their back pocket, and then replace it,\" he said. \"And then, within a matter of weeks, they can kind of be back at that same stage.\"Scientists believe the brush-tailed bettong and other species can thrive if fox and cat populations can be controlled, even if they are not eradicated, Sandow said.\"We are really hoping that the brush-tailed bettong is just one of the first of many species that we can bring back and help restore the bush.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:'Mini kangaroos' hop back in South Australia (2023, May 19)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-mini-kangaroos-south-australia.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "Several wild horse carcasses have been discovered this spring on the southwestern shores of Mono Lake, after California endured a cold and snowy winter.          As multiple feet of snow finally melted around one of Mono County's greatest attractions, U.S. Forest Service officials and volunteers found remnants of a large presence of wild horses\u2014ones that typically range much farther east\u2014that wintered around Mono Lake and left behind massive amounts of manure, ecological damage and in some cases, decaying skeletons.\"Visitors should be prepared to come across horse carcasses and manure,\" Inyo National Forest officials posted on Facebook last week. \"There have been reports of several horse carcasses around the South Tufa and Navy Beach areas of the lake, and this may increase in areas where the wild horses have roamed over the winter season.\"The Forest Service said the horse deaths were probably linked to the long, cold winter, but it noted that an official cause of death hadn't been determined.\"Land managers are not particularly concerned [by these deaths], as this was somewhat of an expected outcome from the long and harsh winter we've had, along with the fact that this horse herd had grown so large in size,\" Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Inyo National Forest, said in a statement. \"This has been and will be the case for many other wildlife species in this area.\"It's also not clear how many horses were found dead.But some Mono Lake ecologists and volunteers worry the deaths, massive amounts of manure and disrupted habitat are the latest signs of a growing problem as more wild horses keep migrating into the Mono Lake Basin.\"Nearly every square meter of trail at South Tufa and Navy Beach was covered in manure, and manure piles blocked handicap access along the boardwalk from the parking lot to the lake,\" according to an online post Thursday by the Mono Lake Committee, a nonprofit that works to protect the lake and its habitats. \"Several horses died at South Tufa over the winter and their scavenged carcasses were draped between tufa towers and along the lakeshore.\"Bartshe Miller, the committee's Eastern Sierra policy director, said based on anecdotal evidence and game cameras, they estimate there could have been a dozen to 200 horses spending the winter in the area, where springs, wetlands and tufa towers are particularly fragile and easily damaged by the large animals. This region is well beyond the horses' typical range, which is more than 20 miles east of the lake in a federally designated herd management area surrounding the California-Nevada border, but Miller noted the animals have started moving west in recent years.      Cox said the wild horses cause \"negative ecological impacts to the sensitive hydrological resources of Mono Lake.\"\"The recent deaths of these horses provide further evidence that the size of this herd cannot be supported by the landscape which they are expanding onto,\" Cox said. She said the Forest Service is \"exploring options\" to update the wild horse management plan\u2014which hasn't been updated since 1988\u2014but no changes have been made yet.A 2019 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommended the Inyo National Forest work on updating the management plan over the next five years for this herd, known as the Montgomery Pass Herd, but that hasn't started.Earlier this month, Inyo National Forest officials and volunteers removed two of the horse carcasses and more than 1,000 pounds of horse manure \"to lessen visitor impacts in the main trail areas,\" Inyo National Forest officials wrote on social media.The wild horses, which are federally protected, are part of the Montgomery Pass Herd, for which officials have designated almost 200,000 acres, 70,000 of which are in the Inyo National Forest, according to federal reports.But the horses started moving west beyond that designated territory and into the Mono Lake Basin in 2015, said Geoff McQuilkin, the Mono Lake Committee's executive director. Last winter, the horses made it to the western side of the lake, where this year they made their presence even more evident.\"They've been generally pushing westward as the population increased,\" McQuilkin said. \"Based on the amount of manure at the site [this year], they were probably caught there due to the heavy snow.\"McQuilkin said the horses were probably attracted to the location because of the availability of some grasses, the lake's freshwater and, especially so this winter, the absence of human activity, as snow shuttered access to the lake.A 2020 census conducted by the Forest Service counted approximately 654 horses in the Montgomery Pass Herd, which is three to four times the appropriate management level established in 1988, with 76% of those horses being outside of the established range, Cox said.\"It would be helpful for people, the habitat and the horses if there was a good plan in place, that protected the horses, protected Mono Lake and its habitats, and protected public safety,\" said Miller, noting that the horses have started to move close to some roadways as well.    2023 Los Angeles Times.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "text": "Searches for sustainable bioenergy and climate change solutions may be one in the same, according to a West Virginia University researcher.          Edward Brzostek, associate professor of biology, and his students at the WVU Eberly College of Arts and Sciences are creating mathematical models to predict how bioenergy crops will enhance and store soil carbon through a renewed five-year grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.Brzostek said he believes the models could present a \"win-win\" that not only improves soil carbon but spurs renewable bioenergy from biological sources. This includes biofuels like corn ethanol and perennial grasses.Soil microbes in Brzostek's model determine how plants might store or lose carbon in the future. That's something current models haven't taken into consideration.\"Our model can predict whether a bioenergy crop is going to be a net carbon benefit or actually result in carbon losses,\" he said. Variables include whether living roots increase or decrease carbon in the soil and how the processes vary with depth and differences in feedstocks.Natural climate solutions like regenerative agriculture can help mitigate the effects of climate change. Brzostek's goal is to determine the most efficient way to facilitate the growth of biofuel sources while cleaning up the environment.\"We don't need any new technology to do this,\" he said. \"It's one of the few ways that you can get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The holy grail of bioenergy crops is to make products or fuel while also storing more carbon in the ecosystem. If you can grow a biofuel that enhances soil carbon, that's a win-win.\"Capturing and storing carbon comes naturally to plants, which take it in through photosynthesis. When the plant dies, the leaf litter and dead root material stay in the soil. From there, different entities go to work on the decaying matter, the vast majority of which is decomposed by bacteria and fungi. When they die, their byproducts\u2014including carbon\u2014remain in the soil.\"It's like a microbial funnel,\" Brzostek said. \"And a lot of the questions that we're asking about soil carbon storage, agricultural management and predicting soil carbon into the future are germane to any ecosystem. They're fundamental questions in ecology that are important to understanding whether our ecosystems can keep the carbon they have and potentially take up more.\"                WVU students Joanna Ridgeway and Dominick Cifelli measure carbon dioxide respiration from soil incubations to get an indicator of microbial activity. Credit: WVU             The research team is also looking at how plants help themselves.\"There's this growing idea that plants can engineer their soil environment by doing things with their roots,\" he said. \"They can leak carbon out of their roots that feed the microbes. That makes the microbes happy. They break down soil carbon and then they give the plant nitrogen in return, which it needs to grow.\"Thus far, research has revealed that miscanthus roots can mine the nitrogen from leaf litter without leading to carbon being lost.The microbes perform an essential role in the process. Fortunately, they're ubiquitous.\"When you walk out in the forest in West Virginia, the microbes are eating everything,\" Brzostek said. \"If they weren't, you'd be drowning in leaf litter.\"His research is carried out under the Center of Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts Innovation, established in 2017 by the U.S. Department of Energy. CABBI, headquartered at the University of Illinois, brings together 20 partner institutions, universities and national laboratories to research sustainable bioproducts from bioenergy crops.Decarbonizing the economy is complicated. Wind, solar and nuclear power are renewable, but some industries\u2014like aviation\u2014cannot be decarbonized.\"Bioenergy can play a part in the new bioeconomy,\" Brzostek said. \"We talk about bioenergy refineries and plants that could produce energy from some bioenergy crop. They'd capture the carbon dioxide and pump it underground. It could lead to a new green industry across much of the rain-fed United States, where you can grow these things.\"WVU students and postdoctoral researchers assisting Brzostek on the research include Joanna Ridgeway, Zoe Pagliaro, Dominick Cifelli, Jessica Burke, Noah Wauls and Stephanie Juice.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the graduate program at Colorado State University?",
    "text": "Sometimes to go forward, you must go back.          A new study from Colorado State University's Department of Soil and Crop Sciences and and the Graduate Degree Program in Ecology found that regenerative practices\u2014including integrating crop and livestock systems\u2014were successful as long-term carbon storage solutions.The paper, \"Restoring particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon through regenerative agriculture,\" was recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The study was led by ecology Ph.D. candidate Aaron Prairie, along with two co-authors: research scientist Alison King and M. Francesca Cotrufo, professor of soil and crop sciences and Prairie's advisor.Their research presented a global systemic meta-analysis looking beyond the impact of regenerative agricultural practices on total soil organic carbon (SOC) alone, instead looking at two main pools.Not all soil carbon is created equallyThe regeneration of SOC in agricultural soils is one of the most realizable, nature-based solutions available to mitigate global warming and sustain food productivity for the future. Over the past two years, Prairie looked at studies featuring experiments analyzing the effects of regenerative agricultural practices compared to conventional or control practices and how these different practices increase SOC. Rather than just looking at total soil organic carbon, he broke it up into particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC).\"That's important because they behave very differently in soil,\" said Prairie, noting that POC cycles faster, creating different implications for management and carbon sequestration.Cotrufo first demonstrated that two functionally different pools of carbon are formed through different processes and her former Ph.D. student, Katherine Rocci, showed they respond differently to global changes.\"This analysis is the first one to demonstrate the differential impact of regenerative practices on both the particulate organic matter and the mineral associated organic matter,\" Cotrufo said. \"There has been meta-analysis before, but on a small subset of management, and only looking at the total carbon. We found that if we study POC and MAOC separately, we can better inform management about what different conditions promote better outcomes.\"      A confirmation of regenerative agricultureOne of the most important findings Cotrufo noted is that regenerative practices have an overall positive impact on SOC pools.\"There are a lot of nuances and variables across the studies that need further research,\" she said. \"But it's a big call for agriculture to move towards a regenerative management model.\"Especially when these practices are combined, Prairie noted.\"We know that they all work individually, but this study also showed the huge potential for the stacked effects even more,\" he said.Decades ago, to increase productivity and lower production costs, the industry largely separated animal production from crop production, focusing on specialization.\"We have increased productivity, but that has come at a huge cost to the environment,\" Cotrufo said.The study showed tremendous potential to greatly increase SOC pools through synergistic interactions between multiple practices, such as polyculture farming, cover cropping, integrated crop-livestock systems and even tillage.While helpful for plant growth, conventional tillage can also lead to erosion and loss of soil nutrients. But when other regenerative practices are in place, it's possible, Prairie said.\"Tillage has a much less negative effect on soil carbon if you are doing things like cover crops and polyculture and other sorts of regenerative practices,\" he said.PatienceAnother finding is that like all good things, increasing SOC takes time.Prairie said his analysis shows that impacts from regenerative practices don't begin showing up in terms of soil carbon until approximately six years after implementation.That's a problem because most SOC programs\u2014including carbon markets, which allow farmers and ranchers to sell \"carbon credits\" equal to the amount of carbon dioxide their land has sequestered\u2014quantify SOC change in a five-year-timeline. which means they aren't going to capture this benefit of regenerative agriculture.\"You have to set the system in motion for plants, microbes and soil minerals to work to regain that organic matter,\" Cotrufo said. \"It's not a quick fix.\"Looking to the past for agriculture's futureThis type of integrated management model was typical before the industrialization of agriculture, Cotrufo said. The farmers in the 1800s and early 1900s had small operations that were diversified. Some producers are returning to that model and demonstrating how that can be effective in regenerating soil carbon today.This analysis opens the door to looking at regenerative agriculture in new ways, Prairie said.\"It shows that there's a lot that we don't understand about specific mechanisms of carbon formation and that more research needs to be done into the combination of these different practices and their viability,\" he said.From there, targeted interventions at a regional scale would be possible to further research why a specific combination of cover crops works better than another, or why a specific timing or variety garners improved results.\"This paper shows that regenerative integration and regenerative principles definitely work,\" Cotrufo said. \"Optimizing them for context is where we need to work next.\"Cotrufo also noted that this is the first time during her career that she's had a Ph.D. student's work published in PNAS, a fact that's made even more notable because the two-year data project required Prairie to learn data analysis on the job.The dataset will also be part of a new modeling consortium, allowing the data collected to live beyond this project.\"There was a big learning curve to decipher how to structure the data, the best way to skim papers,\" Prairie said. \"If you don't have a framework to start with, it feels daunting. But looking at it now, it's very rewarding for me, especially because so much work went into this, and I want it to be used beyond this study; I want it to be useful.\" More information:Aaron M.

    "question_squad": " What is a group of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in industrial processing for several decades?",
    "text": "A team of chemical and environmental engineers at the University of California, Riverside, has found a way to use microbial degradation to break down chlorinated PFAS in wastewater. In their paper published in the journal Nature Water, the group describes how they tested the ability of microbes in waste water to degrade some PFAS compounds and what they found by doing so.          Chlorinated polyfluorocarboxylic acids (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in industrial processing for several decades. In recent times they have become known as \"forever chemicals\" because they break down so slowly in the environment\u2014it has also been found that they can build up in the bodies of animals, including humans.High levels of PFAS in the body have been linked to multiple adverse health effects, such as liver damage, cancer, immune system disorders, and developmental problems. Such problems have led scientists to look for ways to break down PFAS in ways that can be done on an industrial scale. One such approach has involved the use of light-powered catalysts while another has involved the use of reagents. In this new effort, the researchers have taken an entirely different approach\u2014using microbes to break them down.The work by the team involved studying samples of activated sludge\u2014material that is created as part of the process of treating human waste\u2014that might hold microbes able to break apart PFAS. In so doing, they found two kinds of anaerobic bacteria that appeared ripe for testing.After isolating multiple specimens, the research team exposed them to PFAS samples and then watched to see what would happen. They found that both types of bacteria were able to conduct reductive hydrolytic and eliminative dichlorination\u2014which is generally a first step toward de-fluorinating PFAS.Continued study of the microbes showed they were also capable of partially de-fluorinating some types of PFAS. These findings suggested that it might be possible to use bacteria as part of a process involved in breaking down PFAS. The researchers suggest that the reason the bacteria acted on the PFAS was that they found they could be used as a source of carbon and energy. The team also found that the bacteria were able to transfer genes that encoded for the degradation of enzymes present in PFAS.The research team plans to continue testing the bacteria to see if they can develop a process for growing them in an environment that allows for breaking down PFAS\u2014one that would be both efficient and safe.

    "text": "Creating artificial cells with life-like characteristics out of a minimal set of components is a major goal of synthetic biology. Autonomous motion is a key capability here, and one that is difficult to reproduce in the test tube. A team led by physicist Erwin Frey, Professor of Statistical and Biological Physics at LMU, and Petra Schwille from the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, has now made an important advance in this area, as the researchers report in the journal Nature Physics.          The scientists have managed to maintain vesicles enclosed by a lipid membrane\u2014so-called liposomes\u2014in constant motion on a supporting membrane. This motion is driven by the interaction of the vesicle membrane with certain protein patterns, which in turn require the biochemical \"fuel\" ATP. These patterns are generated by a known system for biological pattern formation: the Min protein system, which controls cell division in the E. coli bacterium.Experiments in Schwille's laboratory have shown that membrane-binding Min proteins in the artificial system arrange themselves asymmetrically around the vesicles and interact with them in such a way as to set them in motion. In the process, the proteins bind both to the supporting membrane and to the vesicles themselves.\"The directed transport of large membrane vesicles is otherwise only found in higher cells, where complex motor proteins perform this task. To discover that small bacterial proteins are capable of something similar was a complete surprise,\" observes Schwille. \"It is currently unclear not only what exactly the protein molecules do at the membrane surface, but also for what purpose bacteria could need such a function.\"Two possible mechanismsWith the aid of theoretical analyses, Frey's team identified two different mechanisms that could be behind the motion: \"One possible mechanism is that the proteins on the supporting membrane interact with those on the vesicle surface somewhat like a zipper and form or dissolve molecular compounds in this way,\" explains Frey.\"If there are more proteins on one side than on the other, the zipper opens there, while it closes on the other side. The vesicle thus moves in the direction in which there are fewer proteins.\" The second possible mechanism is that the membrane-bound proteins deform the vesicle membrane and alter its curvature. This change in shape then causes the forward motion.\"Both mechanisms are possible in principle,\" says Frey. \"What we do know for certain, however, is that the protein patterns on the supporting membrane and on the vesicle cause the motion. This represents a big step forward on the road to artificial cells.\" The authors are convinced that their system can serve as a modeling platform in the future for the development of artificial systems with life-like movements.

    "text": "Oscillatory dynamics in fundamental biological processes, such as circadian clocks, segmentation and transcription factor responses, requires precise quantitative control for proper cell regulation and fate decisions.          Many biological oscillators are influenced by multiple oscillatory signals, and their behavior is understood through the framework of Arnold tongues. However, this approach simplifies the situation to a single external signal and one internal oscillator, which oversimplifies real biological systems. Our understanding of how an oscillator responds to two or more external oscillatory signals is currently insufficient.Now, a joint research team from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen has constructed a synthetic oscillatory system in yeast that can respond to dual oscillatory signals. By tightly integrating the experiment and mathematical modeling, the researchers have revealed the cooperative effect of multiple oscillatory signals and the unique phase regulation phenomenon associated with them. These findings suggest a novel path for controlling oscillatory dynamics in both natural and synthetic biological systems.In this study, the researchers modified a previously constructed synthetic oscillator in yeast to acquire a dual-response oscillator. They validated that the system could be synchronized by both periodic \u03b1-factor and ethanol, thus representing a tri-coupled oscillatory system. A mathematical model was also derived to fit the parameters and predict outcomes.Using these methods, the researchers found that two oscillatory signals together could significantly enlarge the entrainment region, increase the ratio of synchronized cells, and delay the onset of chaos. These results suggest that the two oscillatory signals did not linearly combine, but cooperated to stabilize synchronization. The work was published in Cell Systems on May 17.\"I had not heard of such a surprising phenomenon before and it is quite interesting that it is unveiled in a biological context. Moreover, evidence for this phenomenon is provided both theoretically and experimentally, using a synthetic circuit, which is an impressive tour de force,\" said one of the anonymous reviewers of the paper.Moreover, the researchers discovered that the phase difference between the two external oscillatory signals was a critical parameter for the dynamics of the internal oscillator. By tuning this phase difference, one may fine tune the internal oscillation amplitude while the oscillation frequency remains constant. It is further revealed that the optimal phase difference is tightly related to the natural phase difference between the different components of the system in free-oscillating condition.As a final validation of the phase regulation mechanism, the researchers investigated whether tuning the phase difference between oscillatory signals could affect downstream gene transcription. Despite the existence of noise, they found that gene expression level was indeed significantly affected by phase modulation, which was further linked to different amplitudes of the internal oscillator.\"Our novel synthetic cell signaling system, together with mathematical modeling, serves as a powerful platform to study such complex biological problems,\" said Prof. Wei Ping, co-corresponding author of the study. \"The results presented here broadened our general understanding of biological coupled oscillators and emphasized the importance of a correct time pattern in biological regulation. We hope that these findings may inspire scientists from much more broad disciplines.\" More information:Mathias S.

    "text": "Researchers at the University of California San Diego have identified the conditions for cell metabolism to emerge on the early Earth, shedding new light on the origins of life itself, along with the fundamental nature of biological carbon fixation.          \"Notably, this advance can be used to design and develop novel carbon capture methods,\" said UC San Diego bioengineering professor Bernhard Palsson, the Principal Investigator on the study.\"Moving toward a circular carbon economy, the mathematical models and computational tools that resulted from this study will be useful for the development of future C1-carbon technologies, paving the way for the design of economical biomanufacturing systems with a minimal carbon footprint,\" said Amir Akbari, the lead scientist of the study and a data scientist in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.The paper, \"Metabolic homeostasis and growth in abiotic cells,\" appeared in the May 1, 2023, issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Metabolic pathways are the series of chemical reactions that cells use to convert nutrients into energy and other molecules. These pathways are thought to have played an important role in the emergence of life on earth, as they allow cells to utilize energy efficiently and create complex molecules, which are essential for life.One such metabolic pathway is carbon fixation, which is the process by which carbon dioxide is converted into complex carbon-based molecules that could be used by living cells. Researchers have long studied the origins of this process in search of fundamental insights into improving carbon capture technologies.But how did such a process emerge? To find answers, UC San Diego researchers looked to one of the places on Earth where the first carbon fixing cycles are thought to have occurred: submarine alkaline vents.Submarine alkaline vents are areas on the ocean floor where hydrothermal vents release hot, mineral-rich fluids. These vents provide an environment that is conducive to the formation of complex molecules, such as proteins and lipids. This is thought to have been an important factor in the origin of life, as it provided an environment that was rich in the necessary ingredients for life to emerge.In this study, researchers examined the possibility that the first carbon fixing cycles emerged in alkaline hydrothermal vent environments.\"Currently, there is no consensus in the origins-of-life community as to how the first metabolic networks emerged and operated on the early Earth and how they evolved into more complex, self-sustaining chemical reaction networks,\" Akbari said. \"In the metabolism-first paradigm, which our paper falls into, the assumption is that early metabolic pathways operated nonenzymatically, only relying on inorganic catalyst/energy source/reducing agents and simple carbon sources that were likely available on the early Earth.\"      The birth of a new theoryResearch conducted over the last decade has provided clues as to what first metabolic pathways might have looked like, demonstrating that some metabolic-like reactions can proceed nonenzymatically under plausible prebiotic conditions. However, it remains unknown whether all these reactions can spontaneously occur under the same conditions and using the same reagents, or if they necessarily cooperate in a confined environment. Thus, there remains a significant gap between showing the feasibility of individual steps and demonstrating the possibility that different steps can self-organize into self-sustaining chemical reaction networks.\"One of the main results of the paper is demonstrating that the underlying mechanism for why first carbon fixing cycles could only work in a narrow parameter range from first principles, linking it to energy requirement constraints and difficulty of selectively concentrating the organic products of these cycles, which were necessary for the evolution of complex metabolic pathways in abiotic compartments available on the early Earth,\" Akbari said. \"We also demonstrated that both these issues were linked to the membrane potential, implying that the membrane potential was as essential to the emergence of life at its origin as it is to all modern living systems.\"The cycles presented in the team's research are both \"self-sustaining,\" meaning they can continue to operate and consistently reproduce their chemical products using nutrients and energy sources that are available in their environments without outside intervention, and \"self-amplifying,\" meaning they strengthen themselves as they progress. This opens avenues of research that are of particular interest within the origins-of-life field.\"With regard to the specific topic of this paper, the next step is to demonstrate that carbon fixing cycles such as these can be reproduced in the lab non-enzymatically using purely inorganic catalysts, energy sources and reducing agents, which could have existed on the early Earth,\" said Akbari. \"I believe there are several research groups in the origins-of-life field who are currently pursuing this line of research.\"In the bigger picture, one of the long-term objectives of the origins-of-life field is to create artificial life in the lab. More specifically, the goal is to recreate all the steps required to transition from a simple inorganic reaction system to a complex biochemical reaction network capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. The researchers say that this study may prove to be a step in that direction.

    "text": "Throughout their lives, cells encounter environments that vary in terms of how stiff or soft they are. These mechanical conditions impact just how quickly cells can grow, move and carry out basic functions like repairing damaged tissue. Though scientists have long known that cells can sense and respond to different environmental conditions, what isn't clear is whether cells hold onto memories of those past conditions and whether previous experiences might lend them some advantage in future growth.          Jos\u00e9 Almeida, a graduate student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Jairaj Mathur, a graduate student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, working in the lab of Amit Pathak, associate professor of mechanical engineering & materials science in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, set out to test whether cells retain any memory of their past environments. And, if so, how much does that experience enhance their navigation of new, three-dimensional extracellular matrices, the protein-rich networks that surround cells and other body tissues?Almeida and Mathur found that cells can store mechanical memory of past environments, but, more powerfully, cells also transfer that memory to the extracellular matrix surrounding them. In this way, cells effectively reshape their environments to share what they've learned with future cells, via the matrix rather than individual memory, easing the way for future invasions. Encoding the memories externally also ensures the preservation of collective memory beyond the life of a single cell in much less time than similar adaptations could be propagated through gene activation and epigenetic remodeling. These results were published May 5 in the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell.\"This question of whether cells exhibit memory-dependent behavior is a truly divisive topic for biologists,\" Pathak said. \"Some people view cell migration as all about adaption to environments\u2014it doesn't matter where you were before; the entire quest for motion is adaptation. Others would say that of course cells have memory. Cells are complex sets of genes and proteins, and, once they've established a network, the network's not simply going to unravel the moment a cell leaves it.\"      \"What we're learning is that both views are important, and there's not one clear answer, particularly as it pertains to cell migration,\" Pathak added. \"Cells do adapt, but they also remember. Then the question becomes, which parts are memory dependent and which are more adaptation dependent?\"To test cellular memory and its role in cell migration, Almeida and Mathur combined their expertise in biomedical engineering and computational biophysics.Stiff primed MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells expressing green fluorescent protein (left panel) invading into collagen mixed with fluorescent beads (right panel) for about 2 days. Credit: Pathak labAlmeida implanted cells previously exposed to stiff matrices into various 3D collagen environments. These \"stiff-primed\" cells generated higher forces than those trained on soft matrices, which allowed them to more effectively remodel surrounding collagen fibers, regardless of fiber density, and spur invasion into new environments.\"Our bodies are largely composed of collagen, which is a very versatile material that cells can deform and interact with in various ways,\" Almeida said. \"That makes this question of how previous environments affect future environments really complex. Looking at this 3D collagen matrix lets us see cross-environmental effects, including how normal or healthy cells are impacted by primed cells.\"Based on the fundamental physics of collagen deformation and cell movement combined with Almeida's experimental results, Mathur expanded the existing model of cell migration to account for how cells' mechanical memory is transferred onto the matrix through collagen alignment and tension. By remodeling their surrounding matrix, cells lower the environmental resistance they encounter, which eases further cell migration. The advantage gained by primed cells then persists over time and is especially powerful in challenging environments.\"Our model includes key aspects of how cells are modifying their environment, how properties from the first environment allow modification of a secondary environment, and how those features continue from one environment to the next,\" Mathur said.\"We started by thinking about cancer. When tumors develop, the tissue becomes stiffer, and we know cells migrate faster in a stiff environment. But outside the tumor, there's soft, healthy tissue, so why do tumor cells continue to migrate fast during metastasis? It's counterintuitive unless the cells are remembering their past stiff environment.\"By understanding exactly how mechanical memories are stored by cells and shared across environments, the team can make predictions about future cell migration and provide insight into the progression of diseases, such as cancer metastasis and fibrosis development, as well as normal developmental and aging processes. Their plans for future work include further exploration of cell priming, how the extracellular matrix influences cellular gene profiles, and possible interventions to slow or stop undesirable invasions, including targeted therapeutics for cancer treatment.

    "text": "James Cook University scientists have found coral reef fish developed faster growth rates in the warm oceans of the past, 50 to 60 million years ago. These small and fast-growing fishes epitomize the productive coral reefs of today.          JCU's Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Alexandre Siqueira co-led a study with Ph.D. candidate Helen Yan, looking at the evolution of growth rates across coral reef fishes. The paper is published in the journal Nature.Going back millions of years, they found that these reef-associated fishes tended to grow faster and to smaller sizes over evolutionary time.\"These abilities first evolved roughly 50 to 60 million years ago, which coincided with a time when the global temperatures on Earth were drastically warmer,\" the authors said.\"These geologically high temperatures seem to have really pushed the boundaries of the smallest fishes on reefs towards a live-fast, die-young lifestyle, with some of the fastest growth rates in the entire animal kingdom.\"For example, the pygmy goby has the shortest lifespan of any vertebrate in the world. It grows to its full adult size in just over one month and lives for less than eight weeks,\" said co-author Professor David Bellwood.These fast-growing fishes are extremely abundant on coral reefs, contributing to the high productivity of these systems.The authors said that this modern dynamic lifestyle arose before the reefs we know today.\"Corals, which only started forming reefs at a later stage, likely provided the necessary cover for many small-bodied, fast-growing fishes,\" the authors said.\"So, the geologically warm temperatures appear to have led to the evolution of faster growth rates, while the subsequent rise of reefs allowed the retention of these faster lifestyles.\"These remarkable findings also raise concerns over current rates of warming from human-induced climate change.\"Our study suggests that warmer waters might lead to smaller, faster-growing fishes. This means that current warming global temperatures may directly impact fish life strategies,\" said the authors. More information:Alexandre C.

    "text": "Inside bomb-proof frozen vaults underneath the English countryside hides a treasure trove of 40,000 species of wild plant seeds from around the world, many of which are in danger of disappearing.          The world's largest seed bank, located in the sleepy countryside south of London, is in a race against time because two out of five plant species are threatened with extinction, according to scientists.Britain's David Attenborough, a leading environmental figure of international renown, has called the Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) \"perhaps the most significant conservation initiative ever\".\"The purpose is conservation of wild species through seeds, against those species becoming extinct, in the long run,\" explained John Dickie, the project's senior research leader.The 70-year-old has been involved with the MSB since its inception in the late 1990s and the opening of its current home in 2000 to celebrate the millennium.A total of 2.5 billion seeds are stored at the MSB in Wakehurst, 35 miles (56 kilometres) outside London, and at a branch of the capital's Kew Gardens botanical gardens.They come in all shapes, colours and sizes, and belong to 40,020 different species originating from 190 countries.Nearly 20 percent of the world's flora is preserved at Wakehurst, with priority given to plants that are threatened, particularly by climate change, and endemic plants that can only be found in one geographical area.Plants that have a societal function, such as for medical or economic use, also have their place.                The facility is a branch of Kew Gardens botanical gardens.             'Not rocket science'\"Plant species are endangered for a number of reasons but mainly through land use change, and increasingly through climate change,\" said Dickie.\"Some plants will adapt. Others are not adaptable. At least they are here rather than not existing anymore,\" he added.Wakehurst receives new seeds from all over the world every week and then the process of saving them begins.That process is \"based on the technology that has already been in use for crop species\", said Dickie.\"It's not rocket science. Dry it, freeze it. It's just chemistry,\" he added, explaining that, once frozen, the seeds can be stored for decades, probably centuries.Dickie's team of around 20 researchers and various volunteers works in public view in their glass-fronted laboratory.Lucy Taylor is working on Albizia Polyphylla seeds that have arrived from Madagascar.                Priority is given to storing plants under threat.             \"Madagascar is a very interesting place for us. As it was disconnected from Africa, there's a unique flora. And there's also a lot of pressure on land,\" she said.One of her jobs is to separate the empty seeds from the rest.      Iran regrets\"Many of them can be empty or infested with bugs or some kind of disease, so it's important for us to clean them as much as we can,\" explained Taylor.\"We want to have the best quality collection possible but also space in our bank vault is limited.\"The seeds are X-rayed for diseases, and each is given its own identity card, with its name, country of origin and date of arrival at the MSB.The seeds are then stored in glass jars before scientists\u2014kitted up like Arctic explorers\u2014take them to the minus 20 degree Celsius (minus four-degree Fahrenheit) underground vaults, built to withstand floods, bombings and radiation.                    New seeds arrive every week.                                     Seeds are first cleaned then stored in glass jars before being catalogued and stored.                 The largest collection of seeds is from the orchid family.But there are also rare plants, such as the world's smallest water lily and the Deschampsia Antarctica, also known as Antarctic hair grass, one of two flowering plants native to the frozen continent.The MSB, which receives public funding and donations, has partnerships with 90 countries.Some, such as Indonesia, refuse to share their seeds with the MSB, but keep them on their territory and take responsibility for their conservation.Others, however, seem out of reach. One of Dickie's few regrets is that he has no relationship with Iran.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:The Noah's Ark for plants beneath the English countryside (2023, May 19)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-noah-ark-beneath-english-countryside.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the nickname of the ivory-billed woodpecker?",
    "text": "New video and photographs purporting to show ivory-billed woodpeckers flying in a Louisiana forest were published by researchers on Thursday, as government officials said they will make a final decision this year on whether the birds are extinct.          The images\u2014grainy and taken from a distance by drones and trail cameras\u2014offer tantalizing hints the large woodpecker may yet exist almost 80 years after the last agreed-upon sightings, in Louisiana.Several experts said it adds to prior indications of their survival. They called on the government to drop the pending proposal to write off the so-called Lord God Bird\u2014a nickname derived from the exclamation some viewers made upon seeing one.But others dismissed the new research as inconclusive, including a scientist who said some of the footage clearly depicts another type of woodpecker many amateurs mistake for the ivory-billed.The peer-reviewed research in the journal Ecology and Evolution comes from a group that's spent more than a decade searching for the woodpeckers at an undisclosed site.It includes drone video from as recently as October that shows a pair of birds with black-and-white coloring on the wings that researchers say helps distinguish them as ivory-billed woodpeckers.\"The last time a pair of birds was photographed would have been in the 1930s, so it's really extraordinary on that level,\" said Mark Michaels with Project Principalis, which sponsored the work and said it was being shared with federal wildlife officials.The researchers also collected audio recordings of the woodpeckers and most of the search team had some kind of direct encounter, either seeing or hearing them, said Michaels and lead study author Steven Latta with the independent National Aviary in Pittsburgh.An ivory-billed woodpecker would seem hard to miss with a 30-inch (76-centimeter) wingspan and a call reminiscent of a bulb bicycle horn. However, the bird's preferred habitat is dense woodlands that can be hard for people to navigate. Many of those areas were logged early last century and the most recent agreed-upon sighting was in 1944.There have been multiple reported sightings over decades. None fully resolved doubt, and federal officials said in 2021 there was \"no objective evidence\" of the bird's continued existence.After Project Principalis released early results of its work last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service delayed the pending extinction declaration so it could take more public comment.Federal officials want photos or videos all experts can agree on. Wildlife service spokesperson Christine Schuldheisz said the agency would \"receive information on any species at any time.\"One of the study's co-authors works at the wildlife service. A disclaimer said the research does not necessarily represent the agency's views.Millions of dollars have been spent on prior search efforts.Cornell University Professor John Fitzpatrick, who was involved in a years-long search launched two decades ago in Arkansas, said the latest videos and photos when added to prior sightings provide sufficient cause to drop the extinction proposal.\"The region they are working in is highly likely to be able support ivory-billed,\" he said.Michael Collins, a scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory, said the videos show the similar but smaller pileated woodpecker, not the ivory-billed. Collins has published numerous papers on ivory-billed woodpeckers and claims to have seen them himself last decade in the Pearl River area along the Louisiana-Mississippi border.In the new drone video showing a pair of birds, Collins said glare from the sun catches on their wings, causing them to look white.\"All of the flight characteristics are consistent with pileated woodpeckers but not ivory-billed woodpeckers,\" Collins said. \"This video shows a pileated woodpecker.\"Another ivory-billed expert, Geoffrey Hill from Auburn University, said Thursday's study offers a \"compelling set of evidence\" that ivory-billed woodpeckers persist. But Hill acknowledged it was unlikely to settle the debate.\"People have made up their minds. Unless they get smacked in the face with a dead bird or see it on an IMAX movie, they aren't going to change their minds,\" he said. More information:Steven C.

    "question_squad": " What is the term for the amount of fish found in an area's waters?",
    "text": "For the first time, a newly published artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is allowing researchers to quickly and accurately estimate coastal fish stocks without ever entering the water. This breakthrough could save millions of dollars in annual research and monitoring costs while bringing data access to least-developed countries about the sustainability of their fish stocks.          Understanding \"fish stocks\"\u2014the amount of living fish found in an area's waters\u2014is critical to understanding the health of our oceans. This is especially true in coastal areas where 90 percent of people working in the fisheries industry live and work. In the wealthiest countries, millions of dollars are spent each year on \"stock assessments\"\u2014expensive and labor-intensive efforts to get people and boats out into the water to count fish and calculate stocks.That extremely high cost has long been a barrier for tropical countries in Africa and Asia, home to the highest percentage of people who depend on fishing for food and income.Small-scale fishers working coastal waters in many countries are essentially operating blindly, with no real data about how many fish are available in their fisheries. Without data, coastal communities and their governments cannot create management plans to help keep their oceans healthy and productive for the long-term.Now, thanks to advances in satellite data and machine learning algorithms, researchers have created a model that has successfully estimated fish stocks with 85 percent accuracy in the Western Indian Ocean pilot region. This tool has the potential to get data quickly and cheaply into the hands of local and national governments, so they can make informed decisions about their natural resources and keep \"blue foods\" on the table.\"Our goal is to give people the information required to know the status of their fish resources and whether their fisheries need time to recover or not. The long term goal is that they, their children, and their neighbors can find a balance between peoples' needs and ocean health,\" said Tim McClanahan, Director of Marine Science at WCS.\"This tool can tell us how fish stocks are doing, and how long it will take for them to recover to healthy levels using various management options. It can also tell you how much money you're losing or can recoup every year by managing your fishery\u2014and in the Western Indian Ocean region where we piloted this tool, it's no less than $50 to $150 million each year.\"WCS' McClanahan and fellow co-authors used years of fish abundance data combined with satellite measurements and an AI tool to produce this model. The result? A simple, easy to use pilot tool to better understand and manage our oceans.With further development, anyone from anywhere in the world would be able to input seven easily accessible data points\u2014things like distance from shore, water temperature, ocean productivity, existing fisheries management, and water depth\u2014and receive back an accurate fish stock estimate for their nearshore ecosystems.\"We know that during times of crisis and hardship, from climate change-induced weather events to the COVID-19 pandemic, people living on the coast increasingly rely on fishing to feed themselves and their families,\" said Simon Cripps, Executive Director of Marine Conservation at WCS.\"The value of this model is that it tells managers, scientists, and importantly, local communities how healthy a fishery is and how well it can support the communities that depend on it, especially during times of crisis. Once a fishery's status is known, it gives communities and managers the information to move forward to design solutions to improve fish stocks and improve the resilience of local communities, the fishing industry, and local and national economies.\"The algorithm has been shown to work with high accuracy for coral reef fisheries in the Western Indian Ocean pilot region. WCS is currently seeking new partnerships to scale the tool so it can be deployed and fill critical data gaps around the world.The study is published in the journal Marine Policy.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the professor who posited that allowing for 1% imperfection opens the design space by 20%?",
    "text": "Scientists are often trained to seek out the absolute best solution to a given problem. On a chalk board, this might look something like drawing a graph to find a function's minimum or maximum point. When designing a turbojet engine, it might mean tweaking the rotor blades' angles a tiny degree to achieve a tenth of a percent increase in efficiency.          Adrian Bejan, the J.A. Jones Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke University, was busy demonstrating the former for a class full of students when a thought struck him: this is not how nature operates. Evolution is a sequence of design changes happening on their own in a discernible direction; it never weds itself to a single point on a drawing board.An evolving system or animal is free to simply go with what works. Not so much that its performance suffers greatly, but enough that it opens access to other options near the so-called optimal design.With science often looking to nature for clues to solve challenges, Bejan wondered if he might look the opposite way, to predict nature before looking at it. If problem solvers and builders were free to miss the absolute highest mark, how much greater might be the range of designs they consider plausible?That's the question that Bejan posits in a new paper published online May 16 in the journal Biosystems. Using two relatively simple examples\u2014walkways ferrying passengers off a train and a bird flapping its wings\u2014he discovers that the answer is, \"quite a lot.\"\"In engineering, design, theater, architecture or even the organization of this university, any form of design benefits from the ability to make good but imperfect decisions and the freedom to move on and contemplate other opportunities for improvement,\" Bejan said. \"If one is wedded to the idea of the absolute best, nothing new will ever be created.\"In the paper, Bejan first looks at the example of passengers arriving by train and walking across a room with many exit points. With the total area of the room remaining constant but the length and width of the room free to change, he solves for the optimal shape of the room to get all passengers where they're going the quickest. With the solution equations in hand, he shows that providing even 1% wiggle room for imperfection away from the best performance opens the design space by 28%.In his second example, Bejan looks at the flapping motion of birds at nearly constant altitude and speed. Considering the various forces involved\u2014drag during gliding, lift created by wing size, speed and body size, among others\u2014he formulates an equation for the rhythm of wings needed to maintain constant speed with minimum effort. While an optimal answer does exist, Bejan once again shows that allowing for just 1% imperfection above the theoretical minimum effort opens the design space by 20%.Bejan says that he chose these examples because they involved changing only a single variable, a single degree of freedom\u2014the shape for a room or the flapping rhythm for a wing. In more complex examples that involve many variables, these tiny tolerances for imperfection create an even wider range of \"good enough\" solutions.The lesson learned is that science now has a predictive idea of how nature works. By focusing less on finding absolute optimal designs, researchers may use the freedom to iteratively move toward entirely new design concepts that wouldn't otherwise have been within their sight. It also gives designs, methods and entire fields of study the ability to adapt to a changing world.\"The doctrine of chasing the best design is not helpful,\" Bejan said. \"The teaching of science should go hand-in-hand with the freedom to take a shot, hit the vicinity of the mark and move on. The end goal isn't just to hit a bullseye, but to keep more arrows in your quiver to keep taking shots over a long period of time.\" More information:Adrian Bejan, Perfection is the enemy of evolution, Biosystems (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the tree that is the nation's only tart cherry breeder?",
    "text": "Since Michigan is the nation's leading producer of tart cherries, Michigan State University researchers were searching for the genes associated with tart cherry trees that bloom later in the season to meet the needs of a changing climate. They started by comparing DNA sequences from late-blooming tart cherry trees to the sequenced genome of a related species, the peach. However, in a surprise to the researchers, the genetic discrepancies between the species outweighed the similarities. This led the team to create the first annotated Montmorency tart cherry genome and identify the DNA segments that code for each gene.          The research was published in the journal Horticulture Research.\"I naively thought that this would be an easy endeavor; we would simply sequence a few early and late-blooming cherry trees and align the sequences to the peach genome and get an answer in just a few weeks,\" said Courtney Hollender, an assistant professor in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources at MSU. \"I couldn't have been more wrong.\"Genomes contain all the genes and genetic instructions for an organism's development. Sequencing it provides a map for researchers when they are trying to\u2014for example\u2014grow a cherry tree that will bloom later in the season. For Hollender's doctoral candidate, Charity Goeckeritz, an exercise in frustration piqued her curiosity.\"I was trying to align the tart cherry DNA sequences with the peach genome and they just weren't aligning very well,\" said Goeckeritz. \"I was complaining about it to everyone and, finally, one of my friends suggested we just sequence the tart cherry genome.\"Hollender and Goeckeritz teamed up with Amy Iezzoni, MSU professor emerita and the nation's only tart cherry breeder; Kathleen Rhoades, Iezzoni's doctoral student; Bob VanBuren, an assistant professor in the Department of Horticulture and MSU's Plant Resilience Institute; Kevin Childs, director of the MSU Genomics Core; and Patrick Edger, an associate professor in MSU's Department of Horticulture. Together they found that the Montmorency tart cherry genome was more intricate than they originally thought.The complexities come from the tart cherry's parental plant chromosomes. Tart cherries are allotetraploids, meaning instead of having two sets of chromosomes like humans, they have four sets from at least two different species.\"Not only does tart cherry have four copies of every chromosome, but it also is the product of a natural cross between two different species,\" said Goeckeritz, \"the ground cherry, Prunus fruticosa, and the sweet cherry, Prunus avium, that may have happened almost two million years ago.\"While Goeckeritz is using the genome to study bloom time, Rhoades, who conducted the RNA sequencing or gene expression analysis for the project, is working to identify genes that are associated with specific fruit traits, such as color and firmness.Having the Montmorency tart cherry genome sequence opens the possibilities for a tremendous amount of future research that will ultimately benefit the industry and the consumer by growing more trees that can withstand varying spring weather and produce more cherries.\"Before this genome, there were some sequences for tart cherries but it wasn't a complete picture, and I just wanted to have the genome for research and breeding purposes,\" said Hollender. \"Now we have a complete picture, and this research will have a major impact on all future tart cherry research and breeding efforts worldwide.\" More information:Genome of tetraploid sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.)

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the paper published by UBCO's Dr. Clayton Lamb and West Moberly First Nation Chief Roland Willson?",
    "text": "Climbing caribou numbers in northeastern British Columbia prove that collaborations between Indigenous and colonial governments can reverse decades-long declines, but focus needs to shift to culturally meaningful recovery targets, a consortium of researchers and community members say in a new paper published this week in Science.          UBC Okanagan's Dr. Clayton Lamb and West Moberly First Nation Chief Roland Willson co-led the paper, Braiding Indigenous Rights and Endangered Species Law, alongside nine others for the journal.\"Abundance matters. There are many cases where endangered species laws have prevented extinction, but the warning signs of decline can appear long before the laws take effect. People who live and work on the land see these changes\u2014we need to listen and act with them to prevent declines,\" says Lamb, a biologist and MITACS postdoc in UBCO's Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science. \"There is a large gap between what the laws see as species recovery and what communities need for health, food security, and cultural well-being.\"The policy paper builds on collaborations between UBCO's Lamb and Dr. Adam Ford, who have previously published research highlighting recovery efforts of the Klinse-Za caribou herd near the West Moberly and Saulteau First Nations. They also looked at evolving bison and salmon recovery efforts in North America.Researchers heard stories from West Moberly Elders about a \"sea of caribou\" once looking like \"bugs on the landscape,\" but only 38 animals remained in 2013. Those numbers climbed to 115 a decade later thanks to interventions led by Indigenous groups. While these early signs of recovery are cause for immense celebration, the herd remains much smaller than historic levels.\"We need to move past a life support mentality for biodiversity,\" says Ford, head of UBCO's Wildlife Restoration Ecology Lab. \"We must restore nature and the time-honored ways people interact with the land.\"Canada and the United States have endangered species laws that are designed to recover species abundance to levels that will minimize the chance of extinction, but these recovery targets do not take into account culturally meaningful abundance or distributions of plants and animals, the authors say.The paper highlights the current caribou count would only provide about three animals, or one meal per person, per year for Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations. The culturally significant count would require a herd of over 3,000 animals, an abundance more reflective of the historic \"sea of caribou\" level.Naomi Owens-Beek, manager of Treaty Rights and Environmental Protection for Saulteau First Nation, contributed to the research and the policy paper.She says the collaboration between Canadian and Indigenous leaders is essential to preserving traditional ways of life. Some Elders in the region have never tasted caribou, yet it was a staple of their ancestors and provided vital nutrition, material, spirituality, and a sense of place.\"We looked out at the land and thought, 'What do these caribou need to be once again the great herds our Elders spoke about?' We first reduced predation to make sure the caribou weren't lost. Now we're focusing on protecting and restoring habitat,\" she says.\"Caribou habitat has long been mistreated, and now there's so few caribou. These herds need space to thrive, and that's why we're working with the nations, the province of British Columbia and Canada, to heal these lands and increase the population so we can one day go back into the mountains and hunt caribou.\"The paper also examined efforts to restore salmon and bison habitat in North America. Chief Willson says each species shows modest signs of recovery, but that isn't nearly the progress needed.\"Braiding Indigenous rights with laws protecting endangered species can enable nations to respect and safeguard the rights of Indigenous communities, curb the threat of species loss, and ultimately confer broad societal advantages,\" he says.

    "question_squad": " What is the critical time for wildflower viewing?",
    "text": "With Colorado's snowpack ranging from ample to exceptional this spring, hikers who adore wildflowers may already be envisioning days of strolling along lush landscapes of spectacular blooms under columbine-blue skies when all that snow melts.          It could well happen this summer. But because several factors affect the quality of wildflower seasons, and some of them have yet to play out, experts say it's too soon to predict whether wildflower viewing will be good this year or great. It depends on what happens over the next few weeks.\"The mountains are probably going to have a pretty good year,\" said Thomas Bates, a plant ecologist for the Arapaho and Roosevelt national forests, which encompass the northern Front Range high country. \"The critical time is not now, because there's still snow. It's that three to six weeks after the snow melts. We have ample moisture, but it does depend on how that moisture comes off\u2014in the timing, and the rate.\"A hot spell would speed up the rate of snowmelt, perhaps with detrimental effects. If temperatures are cool, or conditions are too wet, blooms could be delayed. Warmth with low humidity could mean some of the snowpack will evaporate without becoming liquid, a process called sublimation.\"That can eat up a lot of the moisture,\" Bates said. \"If you have really dry atmospheres, that's going to prevent water from getting into the system. If it melts too fast and runs off without soaking in, that's going to have an effect.\"In California, which has seen astonishing snowfall and rain from a persistent \"atmospheric river\" of moisture flowing from the Pacific Ocean\u2014which also augmented Colorado's above-average snowpack\u2014\"super blooms\" have been reported. The California Department of Parks and Recreation posted a guide on its website directing wildflower fans to the best places for viewing from the Bay Area to southern California. Desert blooms have been reported in southern California and Arizona.\"For those types of deserts, it really is as simple as when it rains all winter, the flowers are crazy,\" said Tyler Johnson, botanist for the Rocky Mountain Region of the U.S. Forest Service. \"For Colorado, it's not that straightforward, even for our deserts and dry places like grasslands and prairies. Because the vast majority of the wildflowers in Colorado grow for multiple years, there are some legacy impacts from how wet or dry previous winters and summers were that will impact how prevalent the blooms are this year.      \"That's not to say blooms won't be good this year, they will be, it just won't approach 'super blooms' until we get a few wet winters in a row.\"The timing of Colorado wildflower blooms unfolds in an opposite way from fall foliage progression. Wildflower peaks occur first in the southern part of the state and progress north. They also start at lower elevations and progress to higher locations.\"As nighttime minimum temperatures increase and plants are exposed to more sunlight during the day, an increase in soil moisture can signal to the plants to produce more flowers in hopes of producing more seeds,\" Johnson said.\"A super dry summer can blunt the momentum that a wet winter provides, especially for the mountains. The grasslands and foothills will be past their peak by the time summer precip becomes an issue, but a dry summer can have ramifications for next year's blooms. Stressed plants from a dry previous summer won't have many resources ready for next spring.\"This week's heavy rain should give Front Range gardens a major boost.\"The amount of water we had in this storm is so abundant that, if this is followed by warming, we're going to see incredible growth in the next couple of weeks,\" said Maggie Gaddis, executive director of the Colorado Native Plant Society. \"But any early growth is hard to sustain without a strong monsoon later in the (summer).\"Arapaho and Roosevelt forest administrators also manage the Pawnee National Grassland, located 50 miles east of Fort Collins. Johnson said Colorado grasslands are blooming now, as are lower elevations on the Western Slope. He expects the foothills to follow in a few weeks and last until late June. Mountain wildflowers should start blooming around July 4, lasting into August. Mountain blooms could be delayed a week or two, though, depending on when the snowmelt ends.Hikers may have favorite trails for their wildflower hikes, but Johnson recommended adding ski resort trails to their lists. They, too, are located on national forest land.\"Developed ski areas usually have really good and easily accessible wildflower viewing,\" Johnson said. \"Winter ski runs turn into mountain meadows in the summer.\"He cautions that those runs can be steep for hiking, though.\"They feel way steeper going up on foot than they do going the other way on skis,\" Johnson said. \"I'm always surprised how steep even a green run is on foot.\"    2023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the project that was conducted in Washington state?",
    "text": "Since their protection under the Endangered Species Act, wolf populations have been making a comeback in the continental United States. Conservationists have argued that the presence of wolves and other apex predators, so named because they have no known predators aside from people, can help keep smaller predator species in check.          New research shows that in Washington state, the presence of two apex predators\u2014wolves and cougars\u2014does indeed help keep populations of two smaller predators in check. But by and large the apex predators were not killing and eating the smaller predators, known as mesopredators. Instead, they drove the two mesopredator species\u2014bobcats and coyotes\u2014into areas with higher levels of human activity. And people were finishing the job.The study, published May 18 in the journal Science by researchers at the University of Washington, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Spokane Tribe of Indians, reports that bobcats and coyotes were more than three times likely to die from human activity, like hunting or trapping, than from the claws and jaws of cougars and wolves.The findings illustrate how humankind's growing footprint is changing interactions among other species.\"When cougars and wolves moved into an area, coyotes and bobcats employed a specific strategy to avoid apex predators by moving into more human-impacted regions,\" said lead author Laura Prugh, a wildlife ecologist and UW associate professor in the School of Environmental & Forest Sciences. \"That indicated to us that coyotes and bobcats likely perceived these large carnivores as a greater threat to them than people. But when we looked at causes of mortality for the mesopredators, humans were by far the largest cause of death.\"For the study, researchers used GPS collars to track the activity of 22 wolves (Canis lupus), 60 cougars (Puma concolor), 35 coyotes (Canis latrans) and 37 bobcats (Lynx rufus) across two study areas in north central and northeastern Washington from winter 2017 to summer 2022 as part of the Washington Predator-Prey Project. The study areas\u2014which included portions of Okanagan, Stevens, Spokane, Pend Oreille and Lincoln counties\u2014consisted of national forests; recreational areas for camping, hunting and fishing; and lands dedicated to agriculture, timber harvesting, ranching and residential use.      Tracking data indicated that, when wolves or cougars moved into their region, bobcats and coyotes would shift their movements accordingly.\"Coyotes and bobcats started using areas that had twice as much human influence compared to where they were before the large carnivores moved in,\" said Prugh.Researchers also attempted to determine the cause of death for any tracked animals that died during the study period. They discovered that areas with high human activity were far more deadly to mesopredators than those without a large human presence.                This image taken by a game camera at night shows a coyote wearing a GPS collar in September 2018 as part of the Washington Predator-Prey Project. Credit: Savanah Walker             More than half of the 24 coyotes that died over the course of the study were killed by people. Some were shot after preying on livestock. Humans also killed half of the 22 bobcats that died during the study, including several that were attacking chickens.In general, humans killed between three and four times more mesopredators in this study than wolves or cougars, both of which typically avoid areas with high levels of human activity.In the short term, human activity poses little threat to the overall populations of bobcats and coyotes, which are two of the most widespread mesopredators in North America. Neither are endangered, and coyotes in particular are highly adaptable to the presence of people.But not all mesopredator species are as resilient in human areas as coyotes and bobcats, said Prugh. Others reproduce more slowly or may be vulnerable in multiple ways to human activity. Rodent poisons used to keep away pests, for example, can kill fishers, another mesopredator species.Future studies would need to investigate how mesopredators use space and resources in areas with high human activity, and what the risks of these shifts are to people.\"These are not trivial shifts in territory or space,\" said Prugh. \"There are real consequences.\"The findings also add a wrinkle to a working theory of wildlife-human interactions called the human shield hypothesis. Under the hypothesis, the presence of predators in a region causes prey species to move to areas with higher human activity. In Yellowstone National Park, for example, elk have at times moved near hiking trails, which wolves and other large carnivores typically avoid.But the impact of humans in Yellowstone is typically smaller compared to other types of recreational areas or farms, grazing lands and residential developments\u2014leaving some scientists to wonder if humans would be much of a \"shield\" in those areas.\"In these areas with higher levels of human activity, it was unknown whether a mesopredator would perceive the apex predator or humans as the greater threat,\" said Prugh. \"Here, we found that bobcats and coyotes perceived their apex predators as the greater threat, but their strategy of avoiding those large carnivores backfired by bringing them into contact with a much more effective predator: us.\" More information:Laura R.

    "text": "A new study uncovers how the interplay between Sargassum spp., plastic marine debris and Vibrio bacteria creates the perfect \"pathogen\" storm that has implications for both marine life and public health. Vibrio bacteria are found in waters around the world and are the dominant cause of death in humans from the marine environment.       For example, Vibrio vulnificus, sometimes referred to as flesh-eating bacteria, can cause life-threatening foodborne illnesses from seafood consumption as well as disease and death from open wound infections.Since 2011, Sargassum, free-living populations of brown macroalga, have been rapidly expanding in the Sargasso Sea and other parts of the open ocean such as the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, including frequent and unprecedented seaweed accumulation events on beaches. Plastic marine debris, first found in surface waters of the Sargasso Sea, has become a worldwide concern, and is known to persist decades longer than natural substrates in the marine environment.                Some cultivation-based data show beached Sargassum appear to harbor high amounts of Vibrio bacteria. Credit: Brian Lapointe, FAU Harbor Branch             Currently, little is known about the ecological relationship of vibrios with Sargassum. Moreover, genomic and metagenomic evidence has been lacking as to whether vibrios colonizing plastic marine debris and Sargassum could potentially infect humans. As summer kicks into high gear and efforts are underway to find innovative solutions to repurpose Sargassum, could these substrates pose a triple threat to public health?Researchers from Florida Atlantic University and collaborators fully sequenced the genomes of 16 Vibrio cultivars isolated from eel larvae, plastic marine debris, Sargassum, and seawater samples collected from the Caribbean and Sargasso seas of the North Atlantic Ocean. What they discovered is Vibrio pathogens have the unique ability to \"stick\" to microplastics and that these microbes might just be adapting to plastic.\"Plastic is a new element that's been introduced into marine environments and has only been around for about 50 years,\" said Tracy Mincer, Ph.D., corresponding lead author and an assistant professor of biology at FAU's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College.\"Our lab work showed that these Vibrio are extremely aggressive and can seek out and stick to plastic within minutes. We also found that there are attachment factors that microbes use to stick to plastics, and it is the same kind of mechanism that pathogens use.\"      The study, published in the journal Water Research, illustrates that open ocean vibrios represent an up to now undescribed group of microbes, some representing potential new species, possessing a blend of pathogenic and low nutrient acquisition genes, reflecting their pelagic habitat and the substrates and hosts they colonize. Utilizing metagenome-assembled genome (MAG), this study represents the first Vibrio spp. genome assembled from plastic debris.The study highlighted vertebrate pathogen genes closely related to cholera and non-cholera bacterial strains. Phenotype testing of cultivars confirmed rapid biofilm formation, hemolytic and lipophospholytic activities, consistent with pathogenic potential.                (Blood agar test on the left; \u03b2 hemolysis phenotype on the right): More than 40 percent of plastic derived Vibrio isolates displayed hemolytic activity, consistent with pathogenic potential. Credit: Tracy Mincer, Florida Atlantic University             Researchers also discovered that zonula occludens toxin or \"zot\" genes, first described in Vibrio cholerae, which is a secreted toxin that increases intestinal permeability, were some of the most highly retained and selected genes in the vibrios they found. These vibrios appear to be getting in through the gut, getting stuck in the intestines and infecting that way.\"Another interesting thing we discovered is a set of genes called 'zot' genes, which causes leaky gut syndrome,\" said Mincer. \"For instance, if a fish eats a piece of plastic and gets infected by this Vibrio, which then results in a leaky gut and diarrhea, it's going to release waste nutrients such nitrogen and phosphate that could stimulate Sargassum growth and other surrounding organisms.\"Findings show some Vibrio spp. in this environment have an 'omnivorous' lifestyle targeting both plant and animal hosts in combination with an ability to persist in oligotrophic conditions. With increased human-Sargassum-plastic marine debris interactions, associated microbial flora of these substrates could harbor potent opportunistic pathogens. Importantly, some cultivation-based data show beached Sargassum appear to harbor high amounts of Vibrio bacteria.\"I don't think at this point, anyone has really considered these microbes and their capability to cause infections,\" said Mincer. \"We really want to make the public aware of these associated risks. In particular, caution should be exercised regarding the harvest and processing of Sargassum biomass until the risks are explored more thoroughly.\" More information:Tracy J.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the new study that shows the LOME was governed by mechanisms similar to those seen during other mass extinction events?",
    "text": "The Late Ordovician mass extinction event (LOME) has long been viewed as odd compared to other mass extinction events in Earth's history. Contrary to nearly all other major extinction phases known from the fossil record it appears to be instigated by an ice age. A new study, however, shows that the LOME was probably governed by mechanisms like those seen during most other events\u2014including global warming.          Textbooks written during the last 50 years will tell you that 443 million years ago upwards of 85% of all species disappeared toward the end of the Ordovician Period because of a short-lived ice age in what is known as the oldest and probably second most severe mass extinction event in all of Earth's history.However, a new study just published in Trends in Ecology and Evolution by researchers of the universities of Copenhagen, Ghent and California\u2013Berkeley questions this long-standing view because\u2014as the study points out\u2014the massive loss of biodiversity started millions of years earlier than hitherto believed during a warming phase that preceded the well-known glacially associated extinction pulses.The LOME has long been a bit of a conundrum. Strangely two mass extinction pulses seem associated with the waxing and waning of major ice sheets. This is unique as all other extinction events of similar scale later in the fossil record appear to be associated with global warming\u2014a scenario which is also like that observed during the current biodiversity loss.The new study points out that new, temporally better-resolved fossil biodiversity data through the LOME-event show the extinctions to occur in at least three pulses during an up to nine million yearlong interval. This fundamentally changes the Late Ordovician extinction scenario and thus likely also the drivers behind it.Did volcanoes instigate the Ordovician biodiversity loss?Within the Earth Sciences community, many hypotheses circulate as to what drove the event. These disagreements are also reflected within the author group of the paper. However, the authors do agree that the classic hypothesis now is outdated and in need of revision. One revised scenario, for instance, suggests the LOME to be associated with some of the largest volcanic eruptions ever recorded in Earth's history.All evidence points to a much more complex climate history at play during the LOME than previously recognized. And, that extinction triggers could well have been global warming induced by greenhouse gas overloading through volcanic outgassing, as well as deoxygenation of the oceans. Whereas some of this had already been explored for the classic ice age interval, this has not been studied in any detail during this new first wave of the LOME extinctions.      Analogues to the Anthropocene?Today anthropogenic activities have led to a major loss of biodiversity through first and foremost CO2 overloading of the atmosphere, causing global warming and acidification of global oceans, and habitat loss through overexploitation of natural resources.The current biodiversity loss occurs at concerning speeds, likely far outpacing most major extinction events known from the fossil record. So, although perhaps still not at the scale of past mass extinctions, the current rates of extinctions are certainly alarming. The new study highlights these differences in extinction rates, arguing that the LOME exhibits some of the same extinction drivers as seen today albeit naturally induced and thus apparently operating at slower temporal scales than the current human-induced biodiversity crisis. However, fossil biodiversity data through extinction events becomes increasingly better temporally resolved and with that, some concerning new evidence is emerging.Are we currently facing a prolonged biodiversity crisis?The better-resolved data shows that even though these naturally induced extinctions known from the fossil record may be nested in prolonged million-year phases of biodiversity decline, they are punctuated by sudden, catastrophic extinction pulses of just a few millennia in duration.This new evidence from the fossil record may be an indication that once biodiversity loss accelerates, ecosystems fall out of balance, causing much greater and irreversible disruption. This has a concerning resemblance to what is seen during the past few centuries\u2014not least if this means that we are facing a prolonged, irreversible loss of biodiversity similar to what have occurred previously in Earth's history.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the agroforestry system in which farmers grow multiple crops or livestock alongside rubber trees?",
    "text": "Rubber-based agroforestry systems are sustainable intercropping systems in which farmers grow multiple crops or livestock alongside rubber trees to improve their income and/or livelihoods, while also reaping the subsequent ecological benefits. However, it is unknown whether adding more intercropped species to the rubber\u2013tea agroforestry system increases the benefits.          In a study published in Agricultural Water Management, researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yunnan Normal University investigated the dynamics of belowground plant competition, competition effects on plant nutrient status, and plant-soil interactions at different rubber-based agroforestry systems in Xishuangbanna.The researchers selected a rubber monocultural plantation, three agroforestry systems including rubber-tea intercropping, rubber-orange-tea intercropping and a complex jungle-like rubber-tea agroforestry system (a secondary forest), so as to help improve the sustainability and maximize the potential of rubber-tea agroforestry systems.The researchers mainly applied stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope techniques (2H and 18O) to study plant hydrological niche differentiation and stable carbon isotopes (13C) to study plant water use efficiency.To analyze how competition affected plants and soil nutrient status, the researchers measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations of different plant organs (i.e., leaf, stem, and root), litter and soil in these rubber agroforestry systems.The researchers found that rubber trees absorbed water primarily from deeper soil layers as the number of intercropped species increased and the hydrological niche differentiation between rubber trees and the intercropped plants became more apparent.In addition, soil nutrient status first improved, but then declined with an increase in the number of intercropped species. However, negative competition effects offset the benefits of intercropping for soil nutrients and water. Rubber trees are the most competitive species in rubber agroforestry systems. P deficiency is a challenge for the growth of diverse intercropped plants.\"We suggest that when establishing or improving rubber-based agroforestry systems, too many species should not be intercropped,\" said Zhao Fan, first author of the study.

    "text": "Biodiversity loss ranks among the top three risks to humanity, as stated in the 2023 World Economic Forum Global Risks Report. Understanding biodiversity's basic building blocks is essential to monitor changes, identify influencing factors, and implement appropriate policies. However, much of terrestrial animal diversity, including insects, remains unknown or \"dark taxa.\"          For example, the global biodiversity information portal GBIF has nine times more information on birds than insects and arthropods, despite birds only accounting for 0.2% of biodiversity. Prof. Rudolf Meier, head of the Center for Integrative Biodiversity Discovery at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin, highlights the importance of this study in addressing this deficit for effective nature conservation. He emphasizes the need to learn more about insects, as their combined biomass and biodiversity far surpass that of all vertebrates, and they are crucial for survival.To determine the global taxonomic composition of flying insects, researchers used Malaise traps. These standardized traps are widely employed in global biomonitoring programs. However, analyzing samples is challenging when examining individual insects. Thanks to recent advances in sequencing technologies, biodiversity can now be estimated with \"DNA barcodes.\"Researchers used DNA barcodes to assign 225,261 specimens to 25,000 species to 458 families. Dr. Amrita Srivathsan, the study's lead author, noted the surprising finding that 10\u201320 families dominate flying insect communities worldwide. This is remarkable as samples were collected from various climates and habitats like tropical rainforests, montane forests, cedar savannas, scrub forests, thorn fields, mangroves, and swamps, with only Australia and Antarctica not being sampled.Describing insects is a major challenge in understanding life on Earth, with over 80% still undescribed. The authors emphasize that a large fraction of terrestrial animal biodiversity remains unknown to science and will continue to be, unless \"dark taxa\" become a priority target in biodiversity research.The work is published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.

    "question_squad": " What is the threshold of thermal exposure?",
    "text": "Climate change is likely to abruptly push species over tipping points as their geographic ranges reach unforeseen temperatures, finds a new study led by a UCL researcher.          The new Nature Ecology & Evolution study predicts when and where climate change is likely to expose species across the globe to potentially dangerous temperatures.The research team from UCL, University of Cape Town, University of Connecticut and University at Buffalo analyzed data from more than 35,000 species of animals (including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, corals, fish, cephalopods and plankton) and seagrasses from every continent and ocean basin, alongside climate projections running up to 2100.The researchers investigated when areas within each species' geographical range will cross a threshold of thermal exposure, defined as the first five consecutive years where temperatures consistently exceed the most extreme monthly temperature experienced by a species across its geographic range over recent history (1850\u20132014).Once the thermal exposure threshold is crossed, the animal is not necessarily going to die out, but there is no evidence that it is able to survive the higher temperatures\u2014that is, the research projects that for many species there could be an abrupt loss of habitat due to future climate change.The researchers found a consistent trend that for many animals, the thermal exposure threshold will be crossed for much of their geographic range within the same decade.Lead author Dr. Alex Pigot (UCL Center for Biodiversity & Environment Research, UCL Biosciences) said, \"It is unlikely that climate change will gradually make environments more difficult for animals to survive in. Instead, for many animals, large swaths of their geographic range are likely to become unfamiliarly hot in a short span of time.\"While some animals may be able to survive these higher temperatures, many other animals will need to move to cooler regions or evolve to adapt, which they likely cannot do in such short timeframes.\"Our findings suggest that once we start to notice that a species is suffering under unfamiliar conditions, there may be very little time before most of its range becomes inhospitable, so it's important that we identify in advance which species may be at risk in coming decades.\"      The researchers found that the extent of global warming makes a big difference: if the planet warms by 1.5\u00b0C, 15% of species they studied will be at risk of experiencing unfamiliarly hot temperatures across at least 30% of their existing geographic range in a single decade, but this doubles to 30% of species at 2.5\u00b0C of warming.Dr. Pigot added, \"Our study is yet another example of why we need to urgently reduce carbon emissions to mitigate the harmful effects climate change is having on animals and plants, and avoid a massive extinction crisis.\"The researchers hope that their study could help with targeting conservation efforts, as their data provides an early warning system showing when and where particular animals are likely to be at risk.Co-author Dr. Christopher Trisos (African Climate and Development Initiative, University of Cape Town) said, \"In the past we've had snapshots to show the impact of climate change, but here we are presenting the data more like a film, where you can see the changes unfold over time. This shows that for many species the risk is a bit like everything, everywhere, all at once. By animating this process, we hope to help direct conservation efforts before it's too late, while also showing the potentially catastrophic consequences of letting climate change continue unchecked.\"The researchers say that this pattern of abrupt exposure may be an inevitable feature of living on a round planet\u2014because of the shape of the Earth, there is more area available to species in environments near the hot end of what they are used to, such as in low-lying areas or near the equator.A previous study by the same lead authors found that even if we stop climate change so that global temperatures peak and start to decline, the risks to biodiversity could persist for decades after. In another analysis similar to the current study, they found that many species facing unfamiliar temperatures will be living alongside other animals experiencing similar temperature shocks, which could pose grave risks to local ecosystem function.

    "text": "In order to move, cells must be able to rapidly change shape. A team of researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill show that cells achieve this by storing extra \"skin\" in folds and bumps on their surface. This cell surface excess can be rapidly deployed to cover temporary protrusions and then folded away for next time. The study appears May 17 in the Biophysical Journal.          Cell membranes are very flexible, but they can only stretch by approximately 3% without rupturing. Having extra wrinkles of surface area that can expand on demand allows cells to move and divide while safely maintaining cell volume and membrane integrity.\"It's a safety measure because you can't stretch the cell membrane, and if it breaks, the cell will lyse and die, so cells need to have this reserve,\" says first author Maryna Kapustina, a biophysicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"These projections can store massive amounts of cell surface and are highly dynamic, which means they can be rapidly dismounted and immediately rebuilt in other locations on the cell periphery.\"Cell surface protrusions came in various shapes and sizes. Some, called blebs, are small, rounded bumps on the cell surface with very little internal structure. Blebs form within seconds and shrink after several minutes. Larger locomotory protrusions take longer to form but can last for more than an hour thanks to their supportive internal structure, which is made of proteins such as microtubules and actin.A video of ameboid motility in a CHO cell. Credit: Kapustina et al.The researchers used electron and fluorescence microscopy to observe rounded, cigar-shaped, and irregularly shaped cells that were embedded in a 3D collagen matrix, a meshwork of collagen fibers that the cells could squeeze and migrate through. They used fluorescent tags to capture time-lapses of the cells' surface dynamics and locomotion over the course of several hours.The team showed that when the cells were rounded, their surfaces were rough and complex; covered with numerous tiny surface projections such as blebs, microvilli, filopodia, and folds. However, when the cells extended protrusions, these extra wrinkles of \"skin\" unfolded and their surfaces became relatively smooth, especially in the regions adjacent to the protrusions.The researchers think that cell surface excess is important during both mesenchymal and ameboid locomotion, the two main ways that cells move. During mesenchymal locomotion, cells adhere to surfaces in their environment and then use contractile forces to push itself between the collagen fibers or crawl along 2D surfaces. During ameboid locomotion\u2014which allows for much faster movement\u2014cells don't rely on adhesions but are instead propelled by the rapid movements of smaller \"blebby\" protrusions.A video showing fast random motility in Walker carcinoma cells within a 3D collagen matrix. Credit: Kapustina et al.The team thinks that microtubules play an important role in regulating cell surface excess during both mesenchymal and ameboid locomotion, though their exact function is unclear. \"Microtubules might be providing mechanical support for the cell surface, or it might have something to with activating actin beneath the cell membrane to create an active site for a stable protrusion,\" says Kapustina. \"When you don't have this active site to create a stable protrusion, the cells basically just form blebs.\" More information:Changes in cell surface excess are coordinated with protrusion dynamics during 3D motility, Biophysical Journal (2023).

    "text": "A dinosaur specimen from Castell\u00f3n, Spain represents a new proposed species of spinosaurid, reports a paper published in Scientific Reports. The identification of a potential new species suggests that the Iberian peninsula may have been a diverse area for medium-to-large bodied spinosaurid dinosaurs and sheds light on the origin and evolution of spinosaurids.       Spinosaurids comprise of different groups of dinosaurs that are often large, stand on two feet, and are carnivorous. Well-known examples of spinosaurids include Spinosaurus and Baryonyx. It is thought that spinosaurids may have originated in Europe and then migrated to Africa and Asia, but evidence of their existence in Spain is mostly based on fossilized tooth remains.Andr\u00e9s Santos\u2011Cubedo and colleagues analyzed fossil fragments (a right jaw bone, one tooth and five vertebrae) discovered previously in the Arcillas de Morella Formation in Spain and dated to the late Barremian, Early Cretaceous period (between 127 and 126 million years ago). Based on the remains the authors estimate that the specimen is around 10 to 11 meters long. They compared the specimen to data on other spinosaurids to determine its evolutionary relationship to other species.                Protathlitis cinctorrensis gen. et sp. nov., in the foreground.

Based on a comparative analysis of the specimen with other spinosaurids, the authors identified the specimen as both a new species and a new genus of spinosaurid and named it Protathlitis cinctorrensis. The authors named the genus Protathlitis meaning \"champion\" in Greek and used cinctorrensis in the species name to reference the town\u2014Cinctorres\u2014in which the specimen was uncovered.The authors propose that this new species may indicate that spinosaurids appeared during the Early Cretaceous in Laurasia\u2014a large area of land in the northern hemisphere\u2014with two sub-groups of species occupying western Europe. The spinosaurids may have later migrated to Africa and Asia where they diversified. In Europe, baryonychines like Protathlitis were dominant, while in Africa, spinosaurines like Spinosaurus were most abundant.

    "question_squad": " What is the current favored method of targeted gene delivery?",
    "text": "Harvard University researchers have improved a gene editing process for studying and treating genetic disorders. The prime editing method is effective in human cells, targeting single nucleotide variants with the ability to precisely correct pathogenic mutations or install more protective variants. While success in the lab has been promising, translating these effects into living systems where the therapeutic potential could be unleashed has proven tricky.          In a new paper, \"Efficient prime editing in mouse brain, liver and heart with dual AAVs,\" published in Nature Biotechnology, the researchers detail the identification of bottlenecks limiting the effectiveness of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated prime editing in vivo and the development of vectors with increased prime editing expression, RNA stability and modulation of DNA repair.Prime editing is an ingenious strategy of editing that, in its basic configuration, utilizes the Cas9 from CRISPR and attaches an RNA scaffolding and a reverse transcriptase enzyme to create an accurate, precise editing system.One of the advantages of prime editing is that the system does cause double-strand breaks, instead nicking one side to open the DNA. The approach minimizes unwanted insertions and deletions (indels) that can take place with other editing systems.The method works well enough in a lab environment where you can place the editor near its target, but a living body has the added difficulty of needing to navigate a complex environment. In the current round of optimization, the researchers looked to deliver the editing system to the correct location in a living body.The currently favored method of targeted gene delivery is adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which can carry a small payload to a specific locus on the chromosome. That payload capacity is, unfortunately, too small to contain the prime editing mechanism.Some assembly requiredThe solution to overcoming the vector capacity problem was to break the prime editor into smaller pieces that could fit within the AAV cargo limit and would self-assemble when in proximity to each other. With the vector situation somewhat solved, the team moved on to the next series of obstacles.In a series of efforts, the teams made use of a woodchuck hepatitis virus regulatory element, reinforced the RNA scaffolding, switched promoters, ran out of room, added a third AAV vector, optimized the reverse transcriptase enzyme, modified Cas9 with a mutation, made sure everything was working, then removed any elements they could to downsize it back to a two AAV vector system.The resulting prototype for optimized prime editing, v3em PE-AAVs, was tested in mice. Therapeutically relevant levels of prime editing in the mouse brain (up to 42% efficiency), liver (up to 46%) and heart (up to 11%) were achieved. In vivo, prime editing resulted in no detected off-target editing. As a proof of concept, the gene change in the brain was specific to Alzheimer's disease resistance and a gene related to cholesterol-induced coronary artery disease was targeted in the liver.Kind of a big dealThese levels of correcting mutations and rewriting variants summon up a host of often undeserved phraseologies in scientific circles as it truly is a groundbreaking, monumental, landmark, breakthrough, game-changing, unprecedented, a major milestone and, yes, even a paradigm-shifting moment.The genetic mechanisms discovered in the past few decades and all of the knowledge accumulated on causal relationships between cellular machinery and disease pathologies imply that we will one day be able to repair or replace the faulty components of our genome.The latest version of optimized prime editing is not quite ready to proofread the human genome for errors, but it is the closest thing on the planet to a future where we can change the genetic cards we were dealt at birth. A future where cancer risk factors can be eliminated, neurological disorders routinely prevented or reversed\u2014a future where a long list of well-known diseases are simply forgotten. This is a future that is in the testing phase now. More information:Jessie R. Davis et al, Efficient prime editing in mouse brain, liver and heart with dual AAVs, Nature Biotechnology (2023).

    "text": "Purple is a color that has historically been associated with nobility around the world. Japan is no exception. However, its distinct murasaki hue is threatened as the native gromwell plant\u2014synonymous with murasaki\u2014has become an endangered species.          Disease and cross-breeding with non-native species are partly to blame for murasaki's growing demise.Now, a research group including Kyoto University is leading a movement to raise awareness of gromwell's importance in preserving Japanese culture. For example, murasaki revival projects currently underway throughout Japan are investigating the seed's origins and educating the public on the importance of protecting the plant's homogeneity.The team's paper appeared on May 18, 2023 in Plant and Cell Physiology.\"Various non-profits involved in the revival of gromwell are also keen to maintain the silk staining technique through the collaboration with plant scientists,\" says lead author Kazufumi Yazaki.Purple gromwell\u2014or Lithospermum erythrorhizon\u2014contains shikonin derivatives in the plant's root surfaces, which are red naphthoquinones. This natural pigment and medicinal properties are linked to ancient East Asian traditions. Among the range of hues, the most sought dye was the dark purple reserved for members in the top levels of government and the Imperial family, as well as the highest-ranking Buddhist monks.\"The purple color was also used for a national treasure called Koku-Bun-Ji Kyo, the ten-volume Buddhist scripture papers on which letters were written with gold,\" says co-author Ryosuke Munakata of KyotoU's Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere.For medicinal purposes, the roots are prescribed in several remedies as an ointment called Shi-Un-Koh, which is still popular today in treating hemorrhoids, burns, frostbite, and other wounds.Recovery initiatives, such as the Mitaka Gromwell Restoration Project, are focused on ensuring the native gromwell's survival, impacted by the spread of cucumber mosaic virus and sudden environmental changes. Cross-breeding with the European species L officinale is another factor in this plant's uncertain future.Excavated official wooden documents from Kyushu\u2014found to have been used to transport cargo during the Asuka dynasty\u2014were unexpectedly related to gromwell, highlighting its purple dye's crucial administrative role.\"We hope our research raises awareness of murasaki's importance in Japanese history and culture,\" comments co-author Emi Ito of Ochanomizu University.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the plastic-degrading microorganisms found in the coastal salt marshes of China?",
    "text": "A new study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials by researchers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and partners has identified a diverse microbiome of plastic-degrading fungi and bacteria in the coastal salt marshes of Jiangsu, China.          The international team of scientists counted a total of 184 fungal and 55 bacterial strains capable of breaking down polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polyester commonly used in the production of various polyurethanes. Of these, bacterial strains within the genera Jonesia and Streptomyces have the potential to further degrade other petroleum-based polymers\u2014natural or synthetic chains of molecules bound together.The plastic-degrading microorganisms were sampled in May 2021 from Dafeng in eastern China, a UNESCO-protected site near the Yellow Sea Coast. The sampling confirmed the presence of a terrestrial plastisphere, a term that is relatively new to terrestrial ecology as past studies have primarily focused on marine environments. The microbiome of this \"man-made ecological niche\" of coastal plastic debris was further found to be distinct from the surrounding soil.Scientists are increasingly looking at microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to help tackle some of the most pressing challenges of the modern age, including the rising tide of plastic pollution. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), 400 million tons of plastic waste is produced annually, with a steep increase in levels of plastic pollution since the 1970s. Researchers are, however, hopeful that answers to this problem could be found in the plastisphere.Past research has already recognized the potential of microorganisms to tackle plastic waste; a 2017 study led by researchers from China and Pakistan identified a strain of the fungi Aspergillus tubingensis that was breaking down plastic at a landfill in Islamabad, Pakistan. To date, 436 species of fungi and bacteria have been found to degrade plastic and Kew scientists and partners believe their latest findings could lead to the development of efficient enzymes designed to biologically degrade plastic waste.The Research arrives ahead of World Environment Day 2023 on June 5, the theme of which is finding solutions to the plastic waste crisis under the campaign of #BeatPlasticPollution.Dr. Irina Druzhinina, Senior Research Leader in Fungal Diversity and Systematics at RBG Kew, says, \"Microbiologists across the board feel responsible for finding solutions to the ecologically friendly treatment of plastic waste because bacteria and fungi will be the first organisms to learn how to deal with this new material. We have no doubt that microbes will figure out ways to effectively degrade plastic, but this may take thousands of years if we leave nature to run its course. That is why our task is to utilize the knowledge we already possess of microbial biology, to speed up and direct the evolution of microbes and their individual genes to do the job now.\"      Because of their longevity and hydrophobic surface, plastics in aquatic ecosystems have created a 'microbial reef' of sorts for fungi and bacteria to attach to. And in the case of certain biodegradable plastics, they can provide microbes with a source of carbon to metabolize\u2014a food source. At Dafeng, the researchers collected 50 samples of plastic waste from seven different types of petroleum-based polymers: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PU), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).Among the samples, the researchers identified 14 genera of fungi, including the plant pathogens Fusarium and Neocosmospora. Plant-pathogenic fungi draw their nutrients from plants but do so in a way that harms their host. The study's findings indicate these fungi may be better at degrading PCL plastics and other synthetic polymers than saprotrophic fungi\u2014fungi that feed on dead plant and animal remains.Dr. Druzhinina adds, \"The ecological niche of the Dafeng salt marshes is precisely why we chose to investigate the microbial communities present in the plastic waste there, and so far our findings have proven to be both exciting and promising.\"                The study has confirmed the presence of a 'terrestrial plastisphere' ecosystem. The microbiome of this plastisphere was found to be distinct from the surrounding soil. Credit: Irina Druzhinina and Feng Cai             In the wild, fungi play a key role in breaking down organic matter and moving it through the carbon cycle. Over millions of years, the ability to break down many complex and naturally occurring polymers, such as cellulose, has evolved. In fact, the enzymes secreted by fungi are extremely efficient at breaking down complex organic compounds, including carbohydrates and proteins.Alongside the fungi at Dafeng, the research team recognized two genera of bacteria, Streptomyces and the recently discovered genus Jonesia, as promising candidates for plastic degradation. In particular, the species Jonesia cf. Quinghaiensis dominated the 55 sampled bacterial strains.Xuesong Li, Master's Student at Nanjing Agricultural University, China, says, \"The opportunity to work on a project with potentially impactful solutions to tackling rising levels of plastic pollution across the globe was an immediate draw, particularly as this was my first research project. There was some initial concern we might not gather enough data from a single sampling, but the results so far have been overwhelming, and we have had to restrain ourselves from isolating more and more cultures to study their characteristics. And though bacteria proved highly active in this regard, I personally favored working with fungi, as these organisms have vast potential for applications far beyond the degradation of plastic.\"Despite the many exciting developments made in the field, the study's authors warn that our understanding of plastic-associated microorganisms is still in its infancy. Many questions about these ecological niches remain unanswered and the study's authors faced some limitations in precisely identifying the analyzed strains down to a species level.Dr. Feng Cai, Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, China, says, \"What strikes me the most is the sheer power of microbial diversity, especially if you consider how challenging it is to detect them; they are microscopic in size, secretive in nature, and simple in appearance. However, when we shift our perspective and view them through a biochemical lens, we gain access to an abundant complexity that awaits our exploration. It is truly exhilarating to realize we have barely scratched the surface and have already discovered a wealth of potentially promising resources for future technologies. This realization fills me with an incredible sense of satisfaction, knowing that there are numerous discoveries still to be made and that our work can potentially lead to significant advancements in the field.\"RBG Kew is home to one of the oldest and biggest fungaria in the world with more than 1.25 million specimens, but the kingdom of fungi remains one of the great big mysteries of the natural world. Estimates vary but there could be several million species yet to be discovered on top of the more than 144,000 species described to date, and scientists are positive that among them are new sources of food, medicine, and other beneficial compounds.

    "text": "Pale Male, a red-tailed hawk who brought a touch of the wild to swanky Manhattan as he nested above Fifth Avenue for three decades, has died.          Pale Male died late Tuesday after being found ill and grounded in Central Park, wildlife rehabilitator Bobby Horvath posted on Facebook. The hawk was believed to be 33 years old.Horvath posted that he picked Pale Male up and took him to his rehab group's veterinarian, who did bloodwork and X-rays. The hawk later ate a small meal but remained weak and lethargic, Horvath said. \"We hoped for any improvement, but sadly it was not meant to be,\" he said.Pale Male, so named because of his whitish plumage, was first spotted in Central Park as a juvenile in 1991 and began nesting on Fifth Avenue across from the park in 1993.Bird lovers crowded inside the park to watch as Pale Male and his succession of mates hatched and raised their young each spring.The birders were outraged in 2004 when Pale Male's nest with then-mate Lola was ripped from its ledge on the 12th floor of a ritzy apartment building whose residents included actor Mary Tyler Moore and CNN anchor Paula Zahn. Moore publicly opposed the nest removal.The co-op board, which had voted to remove the nest as a hazard, quickly reversed itself and restored a row of anti-pigeon spikes that the hawks had used to anchor their nest, and even added a new metal \"cradle\" on the ledge. Pale Male and Lola rebuilt their nest.As his legend grew, Pale Male was the subject of a 2009 documentary, \"The Legend of Pale Male,\" and at least three illustrated children's books.Horvath wrote in his post that Pale Male inspired bird lovers and photographers around the world. Some took up bird photography professionally, he wrote, but \"most were just local residents or tourists who just wanted an opportunity to get a glimpse of this famous hawk.\"David Barrett, who runs birding Twitter accounts including Manhattan Bird Alert, said that for much of Pale Male's life \"he was not only the world's most famous red-tailed hawk, but he was probably the world's most famous bird, one that people knew by name.\"Barrett said the hawk's fame \"shows that even in an intensely urban place like Manhattan, there are many people who have a fondness for wildlife and feel a connection to it.\"It is difficult to know with 100% certainty that the hawk that died Tuesday was Pale Male, since Pale Male was never banded.Some observers began wondering around 2021 if Pale Male had died and been replaced in the Fifth Avenue nest by another hawk who resembled him.No eggs were observed in the nest in recent breeding seasons, which Barrett said points toward the likelihood that the resident male hawk was in fact an elderly Pale Male, no longer interested in propagating.Horvath said he believes the hawk whose final hours he witnessed Tuesday was Pale Male, a bird he has been following for 20 years.\"I've rescued babies of his that were poisoned,\" Horvath said in an interview. \"I have a history with his family.\"If Pale Male did live past 30, his life was one of the longest ever recorded for a red-tailed hawk. He survived several mates including Chocolate, Blue, Lola and Lima. His most recent mate was Octavia.He is survived by an unknown number of descendants.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Invasive species management has become increasingly reliant on aerial treatments; however, a new research article, published in the journal Pest Management Science, highlights a critical knowledge gap in understanding the interplay of factors affecting flight time and operational costs.          The study presents a comprehensive analysis of a large aerial treatment dataset, painstakingly compiled from 20 years of records from two Australian ant eradication programs. The data sheds light on how the relationships between the bait type and delivery system combinations affect how long it takes to treat an area.The authors note that, until now, they are unaware of any work published in the scientific literature detailing the metrics of aerial baiting.Speaking to SCI, Benjamin Hoffmann, CSIRO Health and Biosecurity, Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre, and lead author on the paper, said, \"This wasn't a planned research topic. I had simply been conducting aerial ant baiting for almost 20 years in numerous projects and had kept detailed data of the treatments in case they would be useful in the future.\"\"Sure enough, they were! The data provided all sorts of insights into the different times it took the different baits to be dispersed by the different apparatus. This data can now be used globally to accurately plan and cost treatments for invasive species management.\"The data revealed notable findings regarding the effectiveness of two different bait delivery systems\u2014motorized hoppers (detachable buckets which hang underneath the helicopter) and side-mounted Isolairs (containers bolted to the sides of the helicopter).Hoffmann explained, \"The data showed that the Isolair was significantly more efficient timewise for bait delivery, counter to what we anticipated. From the pilot's perspective, the Isolair was also much safer, because it is much harder to fly, and particularly to turn, with a heavy weight hanging underneath the helicopter, especially in mild wind.\" However, the study also noted that there was a slight increase in motorized hopper bait dispersal efficiency when two buckets were used instead of one.The authors also compared flight times of a drone vs. a manned helicopter. Over large areas, the helicopter was unsurprisingly more effective, however, Hoffmann noted that \"the drone conducts work where the helicopter can't\u2014such as over small complex areas with infrastructure.\"The study speaks to a need for increased capture and reporting of data by aerial baiting practitioners, to accelerate improvements in efficiency and reduce the cost of aerial baiting.Hoffmann explained, \"The data collection couldn't be any simpler. Multiple people who perhaps already have such data of similar operations (e.g. the hundreds of rodent eradications) could collaborate to write a paper comparing what they have done.\" More information:Benjamin D.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the cellular mechanism responsible for removing RNA molecules and preventing protein formation?",
    "text": "Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body and are produced following the instructions encoded in DNA. By reading their DNA letters, cells produce an intermediate RNA molecule that will give rise to the corresponding protein. Most diseases occur with altered protein levels, which are either a cause or consequence of the condition itself. RNA plays a pivotal role in diseases with altered protein levels by serving as the intermediary messenger between DNA and protein.          Recent years have seen increased research efforts devoted to targeting RNA molecules to block protein production to restore various conditions, with some drugs already on the market for this purpose. Researchers led by Dr. Modesto Orozco in the Molecular Modeling and Bioinformatics lab at IRB Barcelona and the biotech company Nostrum Biodiscovery have performed extensive computational and experimental analyses to produce predictive models capable of determining the structure, stability, flexibility and biology of the RNA-targeting drugs to modulate the expression of certain pathogenic proteins. These RNA-binding molecules themselves are also DNA-based strands and are called oligonucleotides that, by exploiting the Watson-Crick base-pairing model, recruit the target RNA thus impeding its functioning.Published in Nucleic Acids Research, the study involved extensive computational and experimental analyses, the latter performed at the Experimental Bioinformatics Laboratory, headed by Dr. Isabelle Brun Heath at IRB Barcelona. The team validated their predictions in vitro and achieved outstanding results. It was carried out in collaboration with the leading international biotech companies Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, as well as with the Department of Inorganic and Organic Chemistry at the University of Barcelona and the Instituto de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica Rocasolano in Spain.\"The project aims to lay down the guidelines for developing optimal oligonucleotides to target this intermediate step in, potentially, any protein production process. We now know some of the specific modifications these molecules must undergo to improve thermostability, specificity, and sensitivity to degradation by cellular mechanisms,\" explains Dr. Orozco, also a Professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedicine at the Universitat de Barcelona.\"The simulation tools we have developed are an example of precision engineering since we have systematically looked at every possible modification in every position of the candidate molecules in order to amplify its function. This work has only been possible thanks to the technology available at Nostrum Biodiscovery and the key collaboration of first-class partners, such as Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals,\" says Dr. Vito Genna, a former postdoctoral researcher at IRB Barcelona and now Director of the Nucleic Acids Department at Nostrum Biodiscovery.So far, research into these oligonucleotides has been fully experimental as it is a cumbersome process. The biotech company will now further develop these predictors to build a machine-learning suite to guide researchers working on this kind of therapy, allowing them to save time and money.      Three bases for the development of effective inhibitorsIn the search for effective therapeutic oligonucleotides, the researchers have identified three crucial features of any candidate. Firstly, the molecule should form stable hybrids when paired with the corresponding RNA molecule\u2014a process that requires both thermostability and stability over time. Secondly, it should be resistant to serum nucleases\u2014a property that extends its availability within the body.Lastly, the oligonucleotide should produce hybrids that are sensitive to RNase H degradation, which is the cellular mechanism responsible for removing RNA molecules and preventing protein formation. These three key features provide a valuable framework for developing oligonucleotides that can effectively target and treat diseases by regulating protein production.A therapeutic approach that could potentially address a wide range of conditionsA therapeutic approach with the potential to address a wide range of conditions is emerging that interacts with the protein expression pathway and has transversal applicability. This therapy could be used to target any disease related to the overexpression of a given protein or the expression of aberrant forms of proteins, including infectious diseases that undergo the expression of pathogenic proteins in human cells.This broad scope has generated great interest in this kind of therapy in recent years, partly due to the relatively easy manipulation of these molecules, their small size, and their cost-effectiveness.To further advance this therapeutic approach, the researchers will now validate their results in cell cultures and aim to develop an optimal standard that can be used as a basis to target a variety of DNA-RNA hybrids, block a range of proteins, and treat related diseases.

    "text": "In a bid to control the Canada goose population in the city, the Vancouver Park Board has approved a plan for \"lethal removal.\"       The birds were introduced by humans in the late 1960s for hunting and other purposes, and they thrived. But the same is not true for the river ecosystem they feed on.The Canada goose population has grown from about 100 at introduction to more than 20,000, thanks to a combination of plenty of grass and water, few natural predators such as eagles and coyotes, and restrictions on hunting of the birds.According to a study conducted by MSc student Dominic Janus, geese consume important vegetation in the Fraser River estuary. This vegetation provides vital habitat for young salmon and helps protect land from erosion, and when the goose population is very high, the plants have no chance to regrow. Protecting small plots of vegetation from being eaten by the geese helped it regrow, but required fencing, which isn't feasible for large tracts of land, says Janus.Various methods exist to control the geese population, including making the habitat unappealing by planting tall grass, addling eggs to prevent them from hatching, and physically removing the geese to other locations. But these methods can be costly, labor-intensive, and offer only a temporary fix, says Janus. A more permanent option is lethal control\u2014an approach that must be collaboratively developed, grounded in science, and inclusive of the land's ecocultural history, he says.

    "text": "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis followed through with his not-too-veiled hint that he would veto a measure that could have delayed the state's plan to capture and release gray wolves along the Western Slope by the end of the year.       Polis vetoed Senate Bill 23-256\u2014alongside two other measures\u2014Tuesday, his office said in a release. He called the bill \"unnecessary\" and said it would undermine the intent of voters who supported gray wolf reintroduction and expect them to be released by December.The measure, proposed by Western Slope lawmakers whose constituents largely opposed reintroduction, would have hinged the effort on a specific type of federal authorization that would allow state officials to manage (capture, relocate or even kill) the wolves.That authorization\u2014formally called the 10(j) rule\u2014is underway but not yet finished. State officials testified that the federal process could be delayed if the Colorado measure became law, which would have delayed the reintroduction.Polis does want state officials to have the 10(j) ruling in hand, spokesman Conor Cahill said.\"Unfortunately, the legal analysis of this bill is that it would likely delay or even prevent successful 10-J designation, which is why he's vetoing it.\"    \u00a92023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the mollusk that has made its home in North Carolina's freshwater coastal ponds?",
    "text": "North Carolina might need to move a snail. A tiny mollusk known as the magnificent ramshorn has long made its home in the state's freshwater coastal ponds. But sea level rise and storm surges are making those ponds saltier, and the snail can't tolerate salt. The coastal plain that was once the species' habitat has no snails left\u2014the only surviving members are bred in captivity.          The state hopes to reintroduce the snail in one remaining pond, but little of the habitat where it once lived can now support it.\"There are very few places that exist in its known historic range that would still be suitable for it to live,\" said Kyle Briggs, chief deputy director of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission.If the magnificent ramshorn is to flourish in the wild again, it may well have to be somewhere new. It's among many species that are finding their long-established habitats increasingly inhospitable because of warmer temperatures, rising oceans, wildfires and droughts.Some wildlife officials want to help those plants and animals find new homes, a tactic known as assisted migration. In the coming weeks, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to issue a final rule that could allow wildlife managers to introduce endangered species in habitats where they've never been seen before.\"It just allows us to have more flexibility when that is needed,\" said Elizabeth Maclin, division chief for restoration and recovery with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \"When a habitat has been depleted to the extent that it's no longer suitable for a species, we're able to have the tools we need to prevent its extinction.\"States such as North Carolina have been following the proposal closely since the agency released it a year ago. They see the threats climate change poses, and many acknowledge that some species won't survive without help getting to new places.But state wildlife officials disagree about whether the feds' plan is a good idea. In Michigan, wildlife managers hope the change will allow them to move a tiny blue butterfly northward. Arizona officials, however, fear that relocating a wolf to a new habitat could unleash serious ecological risks.Other states, including North Carolina, are willing to consider assisted migration but have deep concerns about how it will be carried out.\"This is a really big opportunity that I'd hate for us to miss, but I think it needs to be done correctly and with the concurrence of the states,\" Briggs said.North Carolina is among several states asking for a \"concurrence\" provision, essentially requiring state wildlife officials' approval before the feds could move a species. The federal agency would not comment on whether it is considering those requests.      The states' roleThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service oversees management of endangered species including the magnificent ramshorn (for marine species, that role falls to the National Marine Fisheries Service). But state wildlife managers often work closely with the feds on plans to preserve and restore those populations, such as habitat restoration projects and landowner incentive programs.And state agencies are responsible for keeping species without federal protection out of the \"emergency room.\" They are wary of threats that could place a species under endangered status, removing it from the state's purview and bringing along a host of federal regulations and restrictions.The Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies, a nonprofit advocacy group representing state wildlife managers, expressed \"cautious support\" for the federal proposal, said Lane Kisonak, the group's chief legal officer. While the group's member agencies have differing views on the rule, he said, they share a belief that any species relocation efforts should require extensive collaboration with the states.\"There's a strong desire by the states to have that cooperation maximized should a final version of this rule be implemented,\" he said.In Hawaii, which has more endangered species than any other state, wildlife officials have welcomed the proposal. Two species of Hawaiian honeycreepers are among the forest birds that are particularly threatened as climate change brings invasive mosquitoes\u2014and deadly avian malaria\u2014into upper elevation forests.\"We're the endangered species capital of the world, and our landscape has changed so much,\" said Kathryn Stanaway, program specialist with the Division of Forestry and Wildlife in the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. \"We want to establish populations outside of their historical range in some instances, and we can do that under state law, but we can't do that under federal law the way it's currently written.\"But some wildlife managers fear the assisted migration of federally protected species could prove harmful to other species under the states' care. Wyoming officials have identified more than 800 species of \"greatest conservation need,\" which are not currently listed as endangered but may require state action to address declining populations.\"Our role is to keep those species common,\" said Angela Bruce, deputy director of external affairs at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. \"Putting endangered species in non-historic ranges could throw off the ecological balance and throw off all the great work we're trying to do. The risk is too high to jeopardize all the other species.\"Much of the Wyoming agency's conservation work comes through voluntary partnerships with landowners, who are wary of the restrictions that often come along with endangered species status. Putting such species in new places would jeopardize those relationships, Bruce said.While Wyoming sees the proposal as a threat to its own wildlife management efforts, others believe it could empower states. Doug Vincent-Lang, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said the rule change could be the first step to one day allowing species to be moved before they're listed as endangered. Such preemptive rescues also would keep those species from falling under federal authority.\"We see [assisted migration] as a means to move species around the landscape to prevent them from getting listed under the Endangered Species Act,\" he said. \"That would allow us to retain state management.\"Vincent-Lang mentioned wolverines as a candidate for relocation. If assisted migration were eventually allowed for state-managed species, Alaska officials could help wolverines migrate to more suitable areas before dwindling snowpack in their current range put them on the endangered species list.The track recordWashington state has successfully reintroduced fishers, a small member of the weasel family that had been eradicated in the state because of trapping and habitat loss. While state wildlife officials support changing the rule to allow such relocations in new ranges, they caution that it won't be an easy answer to habitat loss caused by climate change.\"Translocations are difficult, expensive, they don't always succeed and there's a lot of risks,\" said Hannah Anderson, wildlife diversity division manager with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. \"I would perceive [assisted migration] as another tool in the toolbox, but it's not like we would immediately jump to that.\"While the Washington agency supports the rule change, Native tribes that serve as co-managers of the state's fisheries are skeptical.\"This would need to be done very carefully, in full consultation and collaboration with affected tribes, and we don't see a track record that leads us to believe that that's the way this would move forward,\" said Rob Jones, fisheries policy analyst with the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, a coordinating body for treaty tribes in western Washington. \"This is a half-baked idea without those specifics.\"At least a dozen states weighed in through comment letters sent to the federal agency. Wildlife officials in Oregon, Florida and Missouri all said species may need to be moved to new areas to save them from climate change, but urged the feds to craft strong safeguards that acknowledge the ecological risks of such maneuvers. Leaders in New Mexico and Montana opposed it altogether.\"To introduce experimental populations to new ecosystems renders the experimental population nothing more than an invasive species, threatening the natural balance within the ecosystem unaccustomed to its presence,\" wrote Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican.Many states\u2014both supporters and opponents of the rule\u2014also expressed concern about social and economic consequences. Areas with endangered animals and plants can face severe limitations on development, ranching, mining and other land-use activities that could disrupt the species.Federal officials say that past reintroductions of endangered species\u2014in areas where they'd previously lived\u2014show that the model can work. Such \"experimental populations\" can have more flexible rules that are often less restrictive, but some states still fear that adding endangered species to a landscape could have major economic consequences and public backlash for those regions.Maclin, with the federal agency, said introductions of experimental populations account for the community impact. She pointed to the black-footed ferret, which has been reintroduced with allowances that permit landowners to manage their lands without fear they will inadvertently violate the Endangered Species Act.While states weigh the ecological and economic repercussions of the proposal, many environmental advocates say it would be more costly not to act.\"This is an emergency room situation where species are going to blink out if we don't help them,\" said Elise Bennett, Florida director and senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group. \"We would much prefer and urge preventative care, but within the policy framework of the Endangered Species Act, Congress was quite clear that we have to prevent extinction of a species\u2014no matter what the cost is.\"    2023 States Newsroom.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the sea-dwelling lizard from the age of the dinosaurs?",
    "text": "Scientists have discovered a new species of mosasaur, a sea-dwelling lizard from the age of the dinosaurs, with strange, ridged teeth unlike those of any known reptile. Along with other recent finds from Africa, it suggests that mosasaurs and other marine reptiles were evolving rapidly up until 66 million years ago, when they were wiped out by an asteroid along with the dinosaurs and around 90% of all species on Earth.       The new species, Stelladens mysteriosus, comes from the Late Cretaceous of Morocco and was around twice the size of a dolphin.It had a unique tooth arrangement with blade-like ridges running down the teeth, arranged in a star-shaped pattern, reminiscent of a cross-head screwdriver.Most mosasaurs had two bladelike, serrated ridges on the front and back of the tooth to help cut prey, however Stelladens had anywhere from four to six of these blades running down the tooth.\"It's a surprise,\" said Dr. Nick Longrich from the Milner Center for Evolution at the University of Bath, who led the study. \"It's not like any mosasaur, or any reptile, even any vertebrate we've seen before.\"                Illustration of how Stelladens mysteriosus may have looked. Credit: Dr Nick Longrich             Dr. Nathalie Bardet, a marine reptile specialist from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, said, \"I've worked on the mosasaurs of Morocco for more than 20 years, and I'd never seen anything like this before\u2014I was both perplexed and amazed.\"That several teeth were found with the same shape suggests their strange shape was not the result of a pathology or a mutation.The unique teeth suggest a specialized feeding strategy, or a specialized diet, but it remains unclear just what Stelladens ate.Dr. Longrich said, \"We have no idea what this animal was eating, because we don't know of anything similar either alive today, or from the fossil record.\"It's possible it found a unique way to feed, or maybe it was filling an ecological niche that simply doesn't exist today. The teeth look like the tip of a Phillips-head screwdriver, or maybe a hex wrench.\"So what's it eating? Phillips head screws? IKEA furniture? Who knows.\"The teeth were small, but stout and with wear on the tips, which seemed to rule out soft-bodied prey. The teeth weren't strong enough to crush heavily armored animals like clams or sea urchins, however.\"That might seem to suggest it's eating something small, and lightly armored\u2014thin-shelled ammonites, crustaceans, or bony fish\u2014but it's hard to know,\" said Longrich. \"There were weird animals living in the Cretaceous- ammonites, belemnites, baculites\u2014that no longer exist. It's possible this mosasaur ate something, and occupied a niche, that simply doesn't exist anymore, and that might explain why nothing like this is ever seen again.      \"Evolution isn't always predictable. Sometimes it goes off in a unique direction, and something evolves that's never been seen before, and then it never evolves again.\"The mosasaurs lived alongside dinosaurs but weren't dinosaurs. Instead, they were giant lizards, relatives of Komodo dragons, snakes, and iguanas, specialized for a life at sea.Mosasaurs evolved around 100 million years ago, and diversified up to 66 million years ago, when a giant asteroid hit the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, plunging the world into darkness.

DOI: 10.3390/fossils1010002             Although scientists have debated the role of environmental changes towards the end of the Cretaceous in the extinction, Stelladens, along with recent discoveries from of Morocco, suggests that mosasaurs were evolving rapidly up to the very end\u2014they went out at their peak, rather than fading away.The new study shows that even after years of work in the Cretaceous of Morocco, new species are continuing to be discovered. The reason may be that most species are rare.The authors of the study predict that in a very diverse ecosystem, it may take decades to find all of the rare species.\"We're not even close to finding everything in these beds,\" said Longrich, \"This is the third new species to appear, just this year. The amount of diversity at the end of the Cretaceous is just staggering.\"Nour-Eddine Jalil, a professor at the Natural History Museum and a researcher at Univers Cadi Ayyad in Morocco, said, \"The fauna has produced an incredible number of surprises\u2014mosasaurs with teeth arranged like a saw, a turtle with a snout in the form of snorkel, a multitude of vertebrates of various shapes and sizes, and now a mosasaur with star-shaped teeth.\"We would say the works of an artist with an overflowing imagination.\"Morocco's sites offer an unparalleled picture of the amazing biodiversity just before the great crisis of the end of the Cretaceous.\" More information:Nicholas R.

    "question_squad": " What did the gorillas do when the feeder started working?",
    "text": "A team of Georgia Tech researchers has built an automatic feeding machine for gorillas at Zoo Atlanta that allows the primates to more naturally forage for food. Their ForageFeeder replaces the zoo's previous feeding protocols, which had staff deliver food to the habitat at set times and locations.          With the new machine, feeding times can be set for different intervals every day. This encourages the gorillas' natural feeding behavior, giving them additional random foraging opportunities throughout the day.\"Feeding behavior in wild primates is an important part of their daily lives. Gorillas typically eat and continuously move during daylight hours,\" said Josh Meyerchick, senior keeper of primates at Zoo Atlanta and one of the paper's co-authors. \"We needed an additional tool to help increase their natural feeding behavior, which can provide a source of development and more natural social interactions than human-based feeding.\"The ForageFeeder was built by two Georgia Tech students\u2014an engineer and a computer scientist\u2014in collaboration with zoo staff. The undergraduates constructed it with affordability in mind: The $400 machine is open source and easy to manufacture and modify, which allows zoos around the nation to replicate the device.The invention and a how-to-build-it guide is published in the journal HardwareX.A new idea without a good solutionAndrew Schulz was a familiar face at Zoo Atlanta before earning his Georgia Tech mechanical engineering Ph.D. in 2022. He would sit with the elephants most days, studying how the animals stretch their trunks and use them to inhale food and liquids.In January 2020, Meyerchick made the short walk from the gorilla habitat to see Schulz.\"They wanted me to look at a new project that wasn't working correctly,\" remembered Schulz, now a researcher at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. \"They had built their own automatic feeder for the gorillas using a deer feeder powered by a motorbike battery. A good idea, but it wasn't ideal.\"                Credit: Adam Thompson, Zoo ATL             Deer eat smaller food than gorillas, who typically consume turnips, sweet potatoes, carrots, and other items. When the deer feeder couldn't handle the chunky shapes, the zoo asked Schulz for help.He took the idea back to campus and brainstormed with his Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) team of fellow mechanical engineering students. The VIP program, which includes more than 1,500 students every semester, allows students and faculty advisors to partner on long-term projects that bridge the gap between research labs and classroom curricula.The team tinkered with concepts but then had to pause because of the pandemic. By the summer of 2021, everyone on the team had graduated, so Schulz turned to Maggie Zhang and Nima Jadali. The duo would make the project a reality.      Experience beyond the classroomFor the next year, Zhang and Jadali went back and forth with the zoo, testing various methods and parts.Zhang, the engineer, kept the deer feeder bucket, added some acrylic materials, and printed the remaining parts with 3D and laser printers on campus. It was a trying process.\"I thought I had the skills to pull it off as a third-year student. But then everything kept breaking,\" said Zhang, who graduated this month from the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. \"I had already taken ME 2110, which taught me how to implement designs. Struggling on a project outside the classroom gave me new insight into engineering: when you fail, you have to find a passion to fix it that extends beyond getting a bad grade.\"Jadali, the computer scientist, built the electronics, software, and a remote trigger to activate the feeder. He purposely used simple circuits, batteries, and wires to make the machine easy to replicate.\"This project was deceptively difficult,\" said Jadali, who also graduated this month. \"Often times with my research, I'm the only person who sees and tests much of the code I write. Then it goes into a blackhole after the project ends. This was different; it had to work long after I created it. That's something I've never faced in a research setting.\"The Zoo Atlanta gorillas were surprised when the automatic feeder turned on for the first time this past fall. Credit: Zoo AtlantaFall feedingsThe ForageFeeder has been in place at the zoo intermittently since August. At first, the gorillas didn't know what to make of it. During the first feeding, the primates ran away and looked confused when the food suddenly sprayed around their habitat.Now it's a regular, but random, part of the day. The primates don't know when it will activate or what kinds of foods it may deliver.The feeder is suspended in a tree about 15 feet off the ground. When it's time to eat, food falls out of the bucket into a tray, where a rotor spreads the treats in a circular pattern, much like a fertilizer dispenser. The food can be distributed as far as 30 feet from the feeder.The device hasn't been up long enough for researchers to deeply dive into behavioral data and determine how much the gorillas are moving, nor how much more of the habitat they're exploring.\"But I'm confident we're going to see statistical data that confirms what we're already seeing: more foraging behavior,\" Meyerchick said.If they like what they see in the data, the gorilla care team plans to add as many as three more feeders to the current habitat, which houses nine gorillas.As the team continues to explore modifications to make the process and equipment more durable, other Zoo Atlanta keepers have asked Zhang if a modified version could be used in habitats for other animals. Since installing the gorilla feeder, she and her Capstone Design Expo team created a device to feed the Zoo's tree-dwelling Angolan colobus monkeys.This is a great example of how technology can positively influence animal welfare. Zoo Atlanta is a local, nonprofit institution, and it was great to see Georgia Tech students learning by doing. Technology has been improving human lives for years, and now it's the gorillas' turn.\"Engineers must always respect the projects we work on, even if they're for animals,\" Zhang said. \"I find the zoo projects very interesting because your intended audience can't provide any feedback. If the device stops working, the animal doesn't tell you. If they rip it apart, you can't tell them to stop.

    "text": "A Te Whare W\u0101nanga o Waitaha University of Canterbury (UC) team has spent the last two years investigating whether it's viable to produce maple syrup at scale within Aotearoa New Zealand, and trial plantations have been established near Hanmer Springs and Geraldine.          In the latest stage of this project, Dr. Jamie Robinson, a postdoctoral fellow in the UC Department of Chemical and Process Engineering (CAPE), is using cutting-edge imaging techniques to study cells and structures inside the stems of a sugar maple tree. His aim is to understand the mechanisms that lead maple trees to produce high volumes of sugar-rich sap.Dr. Robinson recently returned from his second trip to Melbourne to visit the Australian Synchrotron, a massive research facility with a suite of X-ray machines that can produce high resolution 3D images of the internal features of living maple tree saplings.\"I use different imaging techniques, both invasive and non-invasive, to study the internal features of sugar maple at high resolution,\" Dr. Robinson says. \"The goal of this work is to find out how maple trees produce large amounts of sugar rich sap, which is processed to create maple syrup.\"\"Our aim is to get a better understanding of how maple sap is generated, and eventually to improve the ability to predict yields. If our research group is successful this will open the opportunity for production of a high value product, maple syrup, in New Zealand, and allow people to buy locally produced syrup.\"Dr. Robinson's findings so far have been published in the journal Micron, and he plans to return to the synchrotron in August and get images of living saplings while they are being slowly frozen and then thawed, to find out how winter temperatures affect pressure inside the stems. The process is non-invasive and doesn't damage the trees.Canada's freezing winters play an important role in maple syrup production by getting sap flowing in large, mature maple trees. Holes are drilled into the trees during winter and natural pressures cause the sap to flow into tubes for collection.Despite our relatively mild winters, CAPE Professor Matt Watson, who is leading the research project, believes producing maple syrup in New Zealand has commercial potential. His team is exploring whether densely planted trees\u2014about 10,000 per hectare\u2014can produce enough sap in moderately cold temperatures to make large-scale production worthwhile.\"We've planted our first maple saplings near Hanmer Springs and have coppice pruned some of them to keep them small,\" says Professor Watson, who is Director of UC's Biomolecular Interaction Centre. \"We're planning a third trial plantation site where we can plant red maple and paper birch trees, which also produce sap.\"UC CAPE Ph.D. student Matt Rennie is monitoring sap flow and local weather conditions, and there are plans to extract a small quantity of sap from the Hanmer sugar maple trees either this winter or next.While commercial production is a long way off, it is projected that 2,000 hectares of maple trees could generate $60 million a year in maple syrup revenue. By absorbing carbon dioxide, the trees would also benefit the environment.

    "text": "A large team of ornithologists, zoologists, biologists and ecologists from across Europe and the U.K. has found that the chief cause of declining bird populations in Europe and the U.K. is the use of pesticides and herbicides by farmers. In their study, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group examined the effects of pesticides and herbicides on bird populations in a variety of locations.          Prior research has shown that the number of birds in Europe and the U.K. has fallen dramatically over the past half-century\u2014some in the field have estimated that there are now 550 million fewer birds in Europe alone. It has been believed that the decline is due to the usual suspects: pollution and loss of habitat. In this new effort, a research team with over 50 members took a closer look to pinpoint the factors most at fault.The work involved studying data from multiple sources, including reports by citizen scientists, in 28 countries in Europe and the U.K. over the past four decades. They not only confirmed massive drops in population numbers for most bird species, but also discovered the main culprit: use of pesticides and herbicides by farmers. These chemicals can harm birds both directly and indirectly, causing medical problems or birth defects and killing off the insects they feed on.The research team found that wild bird population numbers have dropped by 25% in both Europe and the U.K., since 1980. They also found that those that feed on invertebrates saw the largest drops in population. They also noted that farmland species were the hardest hit of any species, with population declines of almost 57% over the period studied. Over the same time period, urban bird population numbers dropped nearly 28% and woodland dwellers by nearly 18%.The team concludes that the rise of intensive agriculture in both Europe and the U.K. has led to massive drops in bird population numbers. They found that urbanization was the second leading factor.

    "text": "A world-first holistic framework for assessing the mental and psychological well-being of wild animals has been developed by UTS Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellow Dr. Andrea Harvey, a veterinarian and animal welfare scientist in the TD School at the University of Technology Sydney.          The significance of the study lies in its potential to revolutionize conservation efforts. Instead of focusing solely on population numbers and reproductive success, the research explores the quality of life experienced by wild animals.This shift in perspective could provide crucial early warning signals about species challenges and population declines, leading to more effective conservation strategies.\"While research on the welfare of domestic and farm animals has been considerable, including indicators of emotional states such as stress, pain and fear, my aim is to bridge the gap by examining the individual lives, feelings and mental experiences of wild animals,\" Dr. Harvey said.\"A deeper understanding of the well-being of wild animal populations can not only enhance conservation efforts, but also provide an indication of the state of the natural environment and its recognized links to human health and well-being.\"The study, which was part of Andrea's Ph.D. research at the UTS Center for Compassionate Conservation, focuses on brumbies\u2014free-roaming wild horses\u2014from Australia's alpine regions, however the framework is widely applicable for evaluating many wildlife species.Dr. Harvey chose brumbies as horse welfare has been studied in domestic environments, providing a bridge to wild animals. The paper, \"Mental Experiences in Wild Animals: Scientifically Validating Measurable Welfare Indicators in Free-Roaming Horses,\" was recently published in Animals.                Checking a camera trap. Credit: Dr Andrea Harvey             Her comprehensive conceptual framework, called the \"10 Stage Protocol,\" includes physical and behavioral indicators for both negative and positive mental experiences in wild animals.\"If you have a dog, you know their usual routine, what they like, and how they behave in certain circumstances. You know if they're happy, sad, or distressed, so this research is shifting that understanding to wild animals.\"We can never be certain what's going through an animal's mind and exactly what they're feeling. It's also an area that scientists have traditionally shied away from. However, we know mental experiences arise from physical states, and we can directly measure these states.\"Nutrition, the physical environment, health, and behavioral interactions all provide clues to the mental experience of animals. This includes negative states such as thirst, hunger, heat and cold discomfort, pain, fatigue, anxiety and fear and positive ones such as satiety, exercising agency, physical vitality and positive social interactions.\"This holistic approach brings together different areas of scientific knowledge, including neuroscience, behavior, and neuroethology\u2014the study of the neural basis of an animal's natural behavior\u2014to interpret the data collected and gain insights into well-being.Dr. Harvey is currently collaborating with researchers studying Australian water birds, such as the straw-necked ibis and pelicans. These birds serve as indicators of water quality and wetland health, which could inform management decisions in the Murray Darling Basin.The welfare of koalas, which have been declared endangered in NSW, is also under scrutiny. Previous koala research has focused primarily on survival and disease. Dr. Harvey's research aims to evaluate overall koala well-being to inform policy decisions around conservation and habitat protection.Dr. Harvey is also working with other researchers studying the welfare of kangaroos and dingoes at a field station in southern Queensland, focusing on the predator-prey relationship, and the impact of climate change and drought recovery.Each species presents unique challenges, such as identifying individuals, evaluating mental experiences in large populations, and considering different environments and habitats.Dr. Harvey acknowledges the challenges of studying the mental experiences of wild animals compared to domesticated ones. The absence of close human relationships with individual animals and the difficulty in observing them for extended periods pose significant hurdles.However, innovative methods like remote camera traps have proven valuable in collecting fine-detail data on wild animal behavior, including body posture and facial expressions.Dr. Harvey's ground-breaking research holds immense potential in transforming the field of conservation biology, by shedding light on the mental experiences of wild and endangered animals.\"Welfare assessments need to be part of all wildlife monitoring, and ultimately all environmental policy decision making, which needs to take into account not just individual species, but also interactions between different species, and their ecosystems.\" More information:Andrea M.

    "text": "Scales, spines, feathers and hair are examples of vertebrate skin appendages, which constitute a remarkably diverse group of micro-organs. Despite their natural multitude of forms, these appendages share early developmental processes at the embryonic stage. Two researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) have discovered how to permanently transform the scales that normally cover the feet of chickens into feathers, by specifically modifying the expression of certain genes.          These results, published in the journal Science Advances, open new perspectives for studying mechanisms that have enabled radical evolutionary transitions in form among species.The skin of terrestrial vertebrates is adorned with diverse keratinized appendages, such as hair, feathers, and scales. Despite the diversity of forms within and among species, the embryonic development of skin appendages typically begins in a very similar way. Indeed, all of these structures develop from cells that produce a localized thickening on the skin surface and express particular genes.One of these genes, called Sonic hedgehog (Shh), controls a signaling pathway\u2014a communication system that allows the transmission of messages within and between cells. Shh signaling is involved in the development of diverse structures, including the neural tube, limb buds and skin appendages.A common ancestorThe laboratory of Michel Milinkovitch, professor in the Department of Genetics and Evolution at the Faculty of Science of the UNIGE, is interested in the physical and biological processes that generate the diversity of skin appendages in vertebrates. In particular, his group has previously demonstrated that hair, feathers and scales are homologous structures inherited from a reptilian common ancestor.Feathers of the chicken embryo are used by scientists as a model system to understand skin appendage development. While it is known that certain breeds of chickens, such as the \"Brahma\" and \"Sablepoot\" varieties, exhibit feathered legs and dorsal foot surfaces, the genetic determinism of this trait is not fully understood.A transient modification for a permanent change As the signaling pathways responsible for this transformation have not been fully determined, Michel Milinkovitch's group investigated the potential role of the Shh pathway. \"We used the classic technique of 'egg candling,\" in which a powerful torch illuminates blood vessels on the inside of the eggshell. This allowed us to precisely treat chicken embryos with a molecule that specifically activates the Shh pathway, injected directly into the bloodstream,\" explains Rory Cooper, a post-doctoral researcher in Michel Milinkovitch's laboratory and co-author of the study.Credit: University of GenevaThe two scientists observed that this single stage-specific treatment is sufficient to trigger the formation of abundant juvenile down-type feathers, in areas that would normally be covered with scales. Remarkably, these experimentally induced feathers are comparable to those covering the rest of the body, as they are regenerative and are subsequently and autonomously replaced by adult feathers.After comparison with embryos injected with a \"control\" solution (without the active molecule), RNA sequencing analysis showed that the Shh pathway is both immediately and persistently activated following injection of the molecule. This confirms that activation of the Shh pathway underlies the conversion of scales into feathers.\"Our results indicate that an evolutionary leap\u2014from scales to feathers\u2014does not require large changes in genome composition or expression. Instead, a transient change in expression of one gene, Shh, can produce a cascade of developmental events leading to the formation of feathers instead of scales,\" says Michel Milinkovitch. This research, initially focused on the study of the development of scales and feathers, therefore has important implications for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms generating the enormous diversity of animal forms observed in nature.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the saRNA vaccine?",
    "text": "While effective vaccines for COVID-19 should have heralded the benefits of mRNA vaccines, fear and misinformation about their supposed dangers circulated at the same time. These misconceptions about mRNA vaccines have recently spilled over into worries about whether their use in agricultural animals could expose people to components of the vaccine within animal products such as meat or milk.          In fact, a number of states are drafting or considering legislation outlawing the use of mRNA vaccines in food animals or, at minimum, requiring their labeling on animal products in grocery stores. Idaho introduced a bill that would make it a misdemeanor to administer any type of mRNA vaccine to any person or mammal, including COVID-19 vaccines. A Missouri bill would have required the labeling of animal products derived from animals administered mRNA vaccines but failed to get out of committee. Arizona and Tennessee have also proposed labeling bills. Several other state legislatures are discussing similar measures.I am a researcher who has been making vaccines for a number of years, and I started studying mRNA vaccines before the pandemic started. My research on using mRNA vaccines for cattle respiratory viruses has been referenced by social media users and anti-vaccine activists who say that using these vaccines in animals will endanger the health of people who eat them.But these vaccines have been shown to reduce disease on farms, and it's all but impossible for them to end up in your food.Traditional animal vaccine approachesIn food animals, several types of vaccines have long been available for farmers to protect their animals from common diseases. These include inactivated vaccines that contain a killed version of a pathogen, live attenuated vaccines that contain a weakened version of a pathogen and subunit vaccines that contain one part of a pathogen. All can elicit good levels of protection from disease symptoms and infection. Producing these vaccines is often inexpensive.However, each of these vaccines has drawbacks.Inactivated and subunit vaccines often do not produce a strong enough immune response, and pathogens can quickly mutate into variants that limit vaccine effectiveness. The weakened pathogens in live attenuated vaccines have the remote possibility of reverting back to their full pathogenic form or mixing with other circulating pathogens and becoming new vaccine-resistant ones. They also must be grown in specific cell cultures to produce them, which can be time-consuming.There are also several pathogens\u2014such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, foot and mouth disease virus, H5N1 influenza and African swine fever virus\u2014for which all three traditional approaches have yet to yield an effective vaccine.Each type of vaccine has pros and cons.Another major drawback for all three of these vaccine types is the time it takes to test and obtain federal approval to use them. Typically, animal vaccines take three or more years from development to licensure by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Should new viruses make it to farms, playing catch-up using traditional vaccines could take too long to contain an outbreak.      Advantages of animal mRNA vaccinesAll cells use mRNA, which contains the instructions to make the proteins needed to carry out specific functions. The mRNA used in vaccines encode instructions to make a protein from a pathogen of interest that immune cells learn to recognize and attack. This process builds immunological memory, so that when a pathogen carrying that same protein enters the body, the immune system will be ready to mount a quick and strong response against it.Compared to traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have several advantages that make them ideal for protecting people and farm animals from both emerging and persistent diseases.Unlike killed or subunit vaccines, mRNA vaccines increase the buildup of vaccine proteins in cells over time and train the immune system using conditions that look more like a viral infection. Like live attenuated vaccines, this process fosters the development of strong immune responses that may build better protection. In contrast to live attenuated viruses, mRNA vaccines cannot revert to a pathogenic form or mix with circulating pathogens. Furthermore, once the genetic sequence of a pathogen of interest is known, mRNA vaccines can be produced rather quickly.The mRNA in vaccines can come in either a form that is structurally similar to what is normally found in the body, like those used in COVID-19 vaccines for people, or in a form that is self-amplifying, called saRNA. Because saRNA allows for higher levels of protein synthesis, researchers think that less mRNA would be needed to generate similar levels of immunity. However, a COVID-19 saRNA vaccine for people developed by biopharmaceutical company CureVac elicited less protection than traditional mRNA approaches.Merck's Sequivity is currently the only saRNA vaccine licensed for use in animals, and it is available by prescription to protect against swine flu in pigs.Persistence of mRNA vaccine componentsAll mRNA vaccines are made in the laboratory using methods that were developed decades ago. Only recently has the technology advanced to the point where the body doesn't immediately reject it by activating the antiviral defenses intrinsic to each of your cells. This rejection would occur before the immune system even had the chance to mount a response.The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines used in people mix in modified nucleotides\u2014the building blocks of RNA\u2014with unmodified nucleotides so the mRNA can hide from the intrinsic antiviral sensors of the cell. These modified nucleotides are what allow the mRNA to persist in the body's cells for a few days rather than just a few hours like natural mRNAs.New methods of delivering the vaccine using lipid nanoparticles also ensure the mRNA isn't degraded before it has a chance to enter cells and start making proteins.Despite this stability, mRNA vaccines do not last long enough within animals after injection for any component of the vaccine to end up on grocery store shelves. Unlike for human vaccines, animal vaccine manufacturers must determine the withdrawal period in order to obtain USDA approval. This means any component of a vaccine cannot be found in the animal prior to milking or slaughter. Given the short lifespan of some of the agriculture animals and intensive milking schedules, withdrawal periods often need to be very short.Between the mandatory vaccine withdrawal period, flash pasteurization for milk, degradation on the shelf and the cooking process for food products, there could not be any residual vaccine left for humans to consume. Even if you were to consume residual mRNA molecules, your gastrointestinal tract will rapidly degrade them.Several mRNA vaccines for use in animals are in early stages of development. Merck's USDA-licensed Sequivity does not use the modified nucleotides or lipid nanoparticles that allow those vaccine components to circulate for slightly longer periods in the body, so long-term persistence is unlikely.Like in people, animal vaccines are tested for their safety and effectiveness in clinical trials. Approval for use from the USDA Center for Vaccine Biologics requires a modest level of protection against infection or disease symptoms. As with all animal vaccines, future mRNA vaccines will also need to be fully cleared from the animal's body before they can be used in animals for human consumption.mRNA vaccines for more farm animalsWhether mRNA vaccines will displace other vaccine types for livestock is yet to be determined. The cost of manufacturing these vaccines, their need to kept very cold and warm up before use to avoid degradation, and the efficacy of different types of mRNA vaccines all still need to be addressed before large-scale use can take place.Traditional vaccines for food animals have protected them against many diseases. Limiting the use of mRNA vaccines right now would mean losing a new way to protect animals from pesky pathogens that current vaccines can't fend off.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the book that I wrote about bees?",
    "text": "As trees and flowers blossom in spring, bees emerge from their winter nests and burrows. For many species it's time to mate, and some will start new solitary nests or colonies.          Bees and other pollinators are essential to human society. They provide about one-third of the food we eat, a service with a global value estimated at up to $US577 billion annually.But bees are interesting in many other ways that are less widely known. In my new book, \"What a Bee Knows: Exploring the Thoughts, Memories, and Personalities of Bees,\" I draw on my experience studying bees for almost 50 years to explore how these creatures perceive the world and their amazing abilities to navigate, learn, communicate and remember. Here's some of what I've learned.It's not all about hives and honeyBecause people are widely familiar with honeybees, many assume that all bees are social and live in hives or colonies with a queen. In fact, only about 10% of bees are social, and most types don't make honey.Most bees lead solitary lives, digging nests in the ground or finding abandoned beetle burrows in dead wood to call home. Some bees are cleptoparasites, sneaking into unoccupied nests to lay eggs, in the same way that cowbirds lay their eggs in other birds' nests and let the unknowing foster parents rear their chicks.A few species of tropical bees, known as vulture bees, survive by eating carrion. Their guts contain acid-loving bacteria that enable the bees to digest rotting meat.Busy brainsThe world looks very different to a bee than it does to a human, but bees' perceptions are hardly simple. Bees are intelligent animals that likely feel pain, remember patterns and odors and even recognize human faces. They can solve mazes and other problems and use simple tools.Research shows that bees are self-aware and may even have a primitive form of consciousness. During the six to 10 hours bees spend sleeping daily, memories are consolidated within their amazing brains\u2014organs the size of a poppy seed that contain 1 million nerve cells. There are some indications that bees might even dream. I'd like to think so.      An alien sensory worldBees' sensory experience of the world is markedly different from ours. For example, humans see the world through the primary colors of red, green and blue. Primary colors for bees are green, blue and ultraviolet.Bees' vision is 60 times less sharp than that of humans: A flying bee can't see the details of a flower until it is about 10 inches away. However, bees can see hidden ultraviolet floral patterns that are invisible to us, and those patterns lead the bees to flowers' nectar.Bees also can spot flowers by detecting color changes at a distance. When humans watch film projected at 24 frames per second, the individual images appear to blur into motion. This phenomenon, which is called the flicker-fusion frequency, indicates how capable our visual systems are at resolving moving images. Bees have a much higher flicker-fusion frequency\u2014you would have to play the film 10 times faster for it to look like a blur to them\u2014so they can fly over a flowering meadow and see bright spots of floral color that wouldn't stand out to humans.From a distance, bees detect flowers by scent. A honeybee's sense of smell is 100 times more sensitive than ours. Scientists have used bees to sniff out chemicals associated with cancer and with diabetes on patients' breath and to detect the presence of high explosives.Bees' sense of touch is also highly developed: They can feel tiny fingerprint-like ridges on the petals of some flowers. Bees are nearly deaf to most airborne sounds, unless they are very close to the source, but are sensitive if they are standing on a vibrating surface.Problem solversBees can navigate mazes as well as mice can, and studies show that they are self-aware of their body dimensions. For example, when fat bumblebees were trained to fly and then walk through a slit in a board to get to food on the other side, the bees turned their bodies sideways and tucked in their legs.Experiments by Canadian researcher Peter Kevan and Lars Chittka in England demonstrated remarkable feats of bee learning. Bumblebees were trained to pull a string\u2014in other words, to use a tool\u2014connected to a plastic disk with hidden depressions filled with sugar water. They could see the sugar wells but couldn't get the reward except by tugging at the string until the disk was uncovered.Other worker bees were placed nearby in a screen cage where they could see what their trained hive mates did. Once released, this second group also pulled the string for the sweet treats. This study demonstrated what scientists term social learning\u2014acting in ways that reflect the behavior of others.Bumblebees demonstrate buzz pollination on a Persian violet blossom.Pollinating with vibrationsEven pollination, one of bees' best-known behaviors, can be much more complicated than it seems.The basic process is similar for all types of bees: Females carry pollen grains, the sex cells of plants, on their bodies from flower to flower as they collect pollen and nectar to feed themselves and their developing grubs. When pollen rubs off onto a flower's stigma, the result is pollination.My favorite area of bee research examines a method called buzz pollination. Bees use it on about 10% of the world's 350,000 kinds of flowering plants that have special anthers\u2014structures that produce pollen.For example, a tomato blossom's five anthers are pinched together, like the closed fingers of one hand. Pollen is released through one or two small pores at the end of each anther.When a female bumblebee lands on a tomato flower, she bites one anther at the middle and contracts her flight muscles from 100 to 400 times per second. These powerful vibrations eject pollen from the anther pores in the form of a cloud that strikes the bee. It all happens in just a few tenths of a second.The bee hangs by one leg and scrapes the pollen into \"baskets\"\u2014structures on her hind legs. Then she repeats the buzzing on the remaining anthers before moving to different flowers.Bees also use buzz pollination on the flowers of blueberries, cranberries, eggplant and kiwi fruits. My colleagues and I are conducting experiments to determine the biomechanics of how bee vibrations eject pollen from anthers.Planting for beesMany species of bees are declining worldwide, thanks to stresses including parasites, pesticides and habitat loss.Whether you have an apartment window box or several acres of land, you can do a few simple things to help bees.First, plant native wildflowers so that blooms are available in every season. Second, try to avoid using insecticides or herbicides. Third, provide open ground where burrowing bees can nest. With luck, soon you'll have some buzzing new neighbors.

    "text": "Hungarian researchers have demonstrated in a new Journal of Applied Ecology paper that citizen science data collected by the public can be used to track the distribution of mosquitoes in the country.          Citizen science, also known as community science, is any activity that involves the public conducting scientific research. Citizen science holds the potential to impact society in a variety of ways. For example, bringing together scientists, policy makers and the general public, as well as enabling researchers to collect large amounts of data efficiently.For the fifth year in a row, Hungarian researchers asked the public to help map mosquito distribution across the country. The Mosquito Surveillance Hungary program utilizes a citizen science approach, with mosquito reports coming from a variety of areas, with the purpose of allowing researchers to paint an increasingly accurate picture of the presence of invasive species in Hungary.Researchers examined whether the data they obtained reflects the true distribution pattern of the investigated mosquito species. The spatio-temporal patterns of mosquitoes (where and when they're found) generated from the reports of citizens (based on the presence/prevalence data of individual species) were compared with field monitoring data collected by researchers. The conclusion determined that the maps based on the reports corresponded well with the results of direct field sampling using traditional trapping protocols.                Citizen science holds the potential to impact society in a variety of ways. Credit: Zoltan Soltesz             These results suggest that data collected from citizen science can contribute to biologically meaningful conclusions regarding invasive mosquito distribution in any country. However, this depends on the reporting intensity of citizens being appropriate. For example, the number of reports must reach a species-specific threshold.The distribution maps of invasive species can be used for identifying ecological predictors that determine such spatial patterns. Alongside this, they are also used for developing mosquito control programs and assessing epidemiological risk.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the DNA section found at the center of the chromosomes?",
    "text": "Centromeres, the DNA sections often found at the center of the chromosomes, display enormous interspecies diversity, despite having the same vital role during cell division across almost the entire tree of life. An international team of researchers has discovered that the variation in centromere DNA regions can be strikingly large even within a single species.          The findings, now published in the journal Nature, shed light on the molecular mechanisms of rapid centromere evolution and their potential role in the formation of new species.There is a special region in each chromosome, often found at its center: its centromere. During cell division, it ensures that new cells\u2014from sperm and eggs to skin and neurons\u2014end up with the correct number of each chromosome. Despite their role in cell division staying the same across almost all plants and animals, centromeres of different species surprisingly vary radically in size and structure. Biologists have termed this contrast between extreme diversity and ultra-conserved function the \"centromere paradox.\"Astonishing centromere diversity in ArabidopsisThis apparent contradiction inspired an international research team led by Ian Henderson (University of Cambridge), Detlef Weigel (Max Planck Institute for Biology T\u00fcbingen), and Alexandros Bousios (University of Sussex) to investigate plant centromere diversity and its origins. The researchers considered two alternative hypotheses: The large diversity could be shared by all species and passed down from a common ancestor. Alternatively, it could be recent, emerging only after the species began to diverge from one another.To find out, the team analyzed a large number of individuals from Arabidopsis thaliana, a common roadside weed and a favorite model organism of plant scientists, as well as material from the sister species Arabidopsis lyrata. The team was surprised that centromeres from very closely related individuals could have substantial structural differences.\"In a way, our analysis proved both our alternative hypotheses true,\" Weigel says. \"There is striking diversity within the species; but comparing the two species with each other, the differences look even more extreme.\"Invasion by a selfish geneThe large centromere variety raises the question how the rapid diversification came about. The team found that Arabidopsis centromeres have recently been invaded by a mobile genetic element called ATHILA. This \"selfish gene\" is a distant relative of retroviruses such as HIV, yet lacks the ability to escape the cell.The invasion is countered by the clean-up machinery that continuously polices the genome for foreign elements: to ensure continued centromere function, the cell frequently overwrites parts of it, thereby often eliminating the new ATHILA elements. This is how small building blocks of DNA may be eliminated or copied over and over again, causing the centromeres to grow or shrink and diversify from one another.\"It seems as if these repeated cycles of invasion and purging are the main drivers of rapid centromere evolution,\" says Fernando Rabanal from Weigel's lab. These mechanisms might be paralleled in other species, including humans.\"It is amazing to think that the hide and seek between centromeres and their mobile invaders may be repeated across species,\" Bousios says. \"The game remains the same, yet the actors change.\"Illuminating the dark matter of a genomeIn future work, the researchers want to deepen their understanding of the mechanisms of these rapid changes and investigate in-depth how centromere variation contributes to species formation. \"We have examined centromere diversity deeply within one species,\" Henderson notes. \"In the future, it will be important to study centromere diversity and evolution across the entire tree of life.\"Henderson's team member Robin Burns says, \"The rapid changes in the centromere raise the question what threshold of differences between two plant centromeres can be tolerated during cell division.\"The open questions sparked by the results are manifold, as their colleague Piotr Wlodzimierz points out: \"We have yet to fully understand mechanisms of creation and evolution of centromeric repeats. Recognizing their diversity is but the first step in a journey that illuminates the dark matter of a genome.\" More information:Ian Henderson et al, Cycles of satellite and transposon evolution in Arabidopsis centromeres, Nature (2023).

    "text": "In a study tracking climate-induced changes in the distribution of animals and their effects on ecosystem functions, North Carolina State University researchers show that resident species can continue managing some important ecological processes despite the arrival of newcomers that are similar to them, but resident species' role in ecosystem functioning changes when the newcomers are more different.          The findings could lead to predictive tools for understanding what might happen as climate change forces new species into communities, such as the movement of species from lower to higher latitudes or elevations.\"Species are expanding their ranges due to climate change, but what are the consequences to the existing structure and function of the ecosystem?\" said Brad Taylor, professor of applied ecology at NC State and co-author of a paper describing the study. \"Our study suggests that when resident and newcomer species are fairly similar, the consequences for ecosystem functions may not matter.\"The study examined a 30-year record of caddisfly populations in normally pristine ponds in Colorado, as well as some fundamental ecosystem functions that can be linked to an ecosystem's health: the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus excreted by the caddisflies and how fast dead plant material, or detritus, that enters ponds is processed by caddisflies. Resident and newcomer species can affect these processes in similar or different ways depending on who is in the community.Shifts in nitrogen and phosphorus levels could lead to changes in the algal community, which is the food source that supports organisms higher up the food chain, such as fish or amphibians, Taylor said.Meanwhile, caddisflies have an important role in detritus processing, as they consume decomposing wetland plant material and break it down into smaller pieces that can be consumed by other organisms. Taylor described an ecosystem with high detritus processing as one that is generally performing well.The study reported three range expansions in caddisfly populations in the 30-year period; in the first two, caddisfly species similar in their processing of detritus and nutrients to resident caddisflies moved into the ponds. One similar newcomer species took a larger role in supplying nitrogen during the 30-year period.Later, during the third expansion, one newcomer that was dissimilar to most resident species took over supplying phosphorus, but the overall processing of detritus and supply of nutrients in the ecosystem did not change despite these alterations in the community, Taylor said, and no evidence was found of declining caddisfly populations over time, although the dissimilar newcomer is on the verge of becoming the dominant resident.\"We have a unique temporal data set that documents the potential consequences of climate-induced introductions of species into new communities and ecosystems,\" Taylor said. \"A key part of predicting the potential effects of shifts in species is knowing the species-specific rates of nitrogen and phosphorus supply and the processing detritus.\"Nitrogen and phosphorus limit algae in these ponds, but how will changes in dominant species like caddisflies alter the abundance of these nutrients?\" Taylor added. \"What will be the change in the algal community when you get more phosphorus supply from a newcomer like the caddisfly we call nemo\u2014short for the genus Nemotaulias\u2014for example?\"Taylor and his collaborators intend to follow up on the long-term consequences of these expansions by examining their effects on other invertebrates and vertebrates given these changes.\"We know these range expansions are occurring and are going to continue occurring,\" Taylor said. \"We were able to measure three ecosystem processes in this study\u2014there is still a lot more to explore.\"The study appears in Communications Biology.

    "text": "The Clinic for Animal Reproduction, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universitaet Berlin in Germany, has investigated the intensive molecular changes that take place during dog pregnancy.          In the paper, \"Metabolomics during canine pregnancy and lactation,\" published in PLOS One, the researchers identify metabolites showing specific changes in blood serum at different phases of pregnancy and lactation, providing a baseline of normal metabolic changes during a healthy canine pregnancy and birthing.During pregnancy and giving birth, female dogs have to cope with various challenges such as providing nutrients for the growth of the fetuses, hormonal changes, whelping, nursing, milk production, and uterine involution.While this may be true for all mammalian mothers, pregnancy-related changes in metabolic parameters are more intensive in dogs than in many other species because fetal development is rapid. The duration of pregnancy in dogs averages just 63 days, with an average of five to six puppies per litter, though it can be as high as 12. Birthing usually lasts several hours, is laborious, and often exhausting.The study included 27 privately owned female dogs of 21 different breeds, sampled at six time points: during heat, in early, mid and late pregnancy, at the suspected peak of lactation and after weaning. Researchers quantified 123 molecular measurables, including a comprehensive lipoprotein analysis, fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterols, amino acids, glycolysis- and fluid balance-related metabolites, and a novel inflammatory marker glycoprotein acetyls, similar to a method utilized in human metabolomics studies on pregnancy.Metabolites were then grouped into five clusters based on concentration patterns and biochemical relationships between the metabolites: high in mid-pregnancy, low in mid-pregnancy, high in late pregnancy, high in lactation, and low in lactation.Several metabolites\u2014albumin, glycoprotein acetyls, fatty acids, lipoproteins, glucose, and some amino acids\u2014followed similar patterns during pregnancy and lactation as found in humans. The patterns of branched-chain amino acids, alanine and histidine differed between these species. For most metabolites, it is unclear if observed changes are from resorption from the intestines, modified production, or metabolism in the maternal or fetal tissues.The researchers hope that knowledge of these molecular changes during pregnancy and the relation to discrete biological events such as embryo development and placentation will support a better understanding of the processes and the causes of infertility or disease and aid in identifying treatments for these conditions in the future.

    "text": "One of the world's first attempts to relocate an animal species threatened by climate change\u2014Western Australia's critically endangered Western Swamp Turtle\u2014has delivered early findings about the importance of replicating the natural micro-climate conditions.          The Western Swamp Turtle, which was thought to be extinct until a chance discovery in the 1950s, now numbers fewer than 70 wild adults due to habitat loss and the impacts of a drying climate and groundwater extraction in the south-west region of WA.In the Assisted Colonization project led by researchers from The University of Western Australia, 48 juvenile Western Swamp Turtles bred at Perth Zoo were released into three swamp sites with contrasting micro-climate conditions. The northernmost site was near Moore River and the southernmost near Northcliffe\u2014about 380 km apart.Researchers monitored the turtles using \"biologgers\" attached to the turtles, with body temperatures, activity and sun-basking time being key measures of performance that could be related to each individual's growth.Lead author of the article published in Functional Ecology Siobhan Paget, a former Bachelor of Philosophy student from UWA, said juvenile turtles released into more southern, and slightly colder, wetland were less active and grew more slowly than their northern counterparts.Credit: University of Western Australia\"We concluded that slower growth of turtles in the southern wetland was likely a result of their lower body temperatures, stemming from a reduced ability to thermoregulate in water,\" Paget said.\"For assisted colonization of this species to be successful, wetlands must offer aquatic microclimates that are sufficiently warm to promote foraging activity that leads to growth and maturation.\"Associate Professor Nicki Mitchell, who leads the project at UWA's School of Biological Sciences, said the research is believed to be the first in the world to explore the introduction of a threatened vertebrate species to a new habitat because of climate change and delivers broader lessons about the value of an experimental approach to species conservation.\"We know that assisted colonization as a response to climate change will only work if species are well suited to their new habitats,\" she said.\"However, it is hard to anticipate how a species will perform in novel circumstances, especially for a species like the western swamp turtle which may live for 100 years.\"Careful planning and evaluation of assisted colonization will become increasingly vital as we confront our biodiversity crisis. Fortunately, for the western swamp turtle, while we have abandoned one trial site for assisted colonization, we are seeing better outcomes at an alternative southern site.\" More information:Siobhan Paget et al, Activity of a freshwater turtle varies across a latitudinal gradient: Implications for the success of assisted colonisation, Functional Ecology (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the earliest animal that has been found?",
    "text": "For more than a century, biologists have wondered what the earliest animals were like when they first arose in the ancient oceans more than half a billion years ago.          Searching among today's most primitive-looking animals for the earliest branch of the animal tree of life, scientists gradually narrowed the possibilities down to two groups: sponges, which spend their entire adult lives in one spot, filtering food from seawater; and comb jellies, voracious predators that oar their way through the world's oceans in search of food.In a new study published this week in the journal Nature, researchers use a novel approach based on chromosome structure to come up with a definitive answer: Comb jellies, or ctenophores (pronounced teen'-a-fores), were the first lineage to branch off from the animal tree. Sponges were next, followed by the diversification of all other animals, including the lineage leading to humans.Although the researchers determined that the ctenophore lineage branched off before sponges, both groups of animals have continued to evolve from their common ancestor. Nevertheless, evolutionary biologists believe that these groups still share characteristics with the earliest animals, and that studying these early branches of the animal tree of life can shed light on how animals arose and evolved to the diversity of species we see around us today.\"The most recent common ancestor of all animals probably lived 600 or 700 million years ago. It's hard to know what they were like because they were soft-bodied animals and didn't leave a direct fossil record. But we can use comparisons across living animals to learn about our common ancestors,\" said Daniel Rokhsar, University of California, Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and co-corresponding author of the paper along with Darrin Schultz and Oleg Simakov of the University of Vienna. \"It's exciting\u2014we're looking back deep in time where we have no hope of getting fossils, but by comparing genomes, we're learning things about these very early ancestors.\"Understanding the relationships among animal lineages will help scientists understand how key features of animal biology, such as the nervous system, muscles and digestive tract, evolved over time, the researchers say.\"We developed a new way to take one of the deepest glimpses possible into the origins of animal life,\" said Schultz, the lead author and a former UC Santa Cruz graduate student and researcher at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Vienna. \"This finding will lay the foundation for the scientific community to begin to develop a better understanding of how animals have evolved.\"      What's an animal?Most familiar animals, including worms, flies, mollusks, sea stars and vertebrates\u2014and including humans\u2014have a head with a centralized brain, a gut running from mouth to anus, muscles and other shared features that had already evolved by the time of the famed \"Cambrian Explosion\" around 500 million years ago. Together, these animals are called bilaterians.Other bona fide animals, however, such as jellyfish, sea anemones, sponges and ctenophores, have simpler body plans. These creatures lack many bilaterian features\u2014for example, they lack a defined brain and may not even have a nervous system or muscles\u2014but still share the hallmarks of animal life, notably the development of multicellular bodies from a fertilized egg.The evolutionary relationships among these diverse creatures\u2014specifically, the order in which each of the lineages branched off from the main trunk of the animal tree of life\u2014has been controversial.With the rise of DNA sequencing, biologists were able to compare the sequences of genes shared by animals to construct a family tree that illustrates how animals and their genes evolved over time since the earliest animals arose in the Precambrian Period.But these phylogenetic methods based on gene sequences failed to resolve the controversy over whether sponges or comb jellies were the earliest branch of the animal tree, in part because of the deep antiquity of their divergence, Rokhsar said.\"The results of sophisticated sequence-based studies were basically split,\" he said. \"Some researchers did well-designed analyses and found that sponges branched first. Others did equally complex and justifiable studies and got ctenophores. There hasn't really been any convergence to a definitive answer.\"Just looking at them, sponges seem quite primitive. After their free-swimming larval stage, they settle down and generally remain in one place, gently sweeping water through their pores to capture small food particles dissolved in sea water. They have no nerves or muscles, though their hard parts make nice scrubbers in the bath.\"Traditionally, sponges have been widely considered to be the earliest surviving branch of the animal tree, because sponges don't have a nervous system, they don't have muscles, and they look a little bit like colonial versions of some unicellular protozoans,\" Rokhsar said.\"And so, it was a nice story: First came the unicellular protozoans, and then sponge-like multicellular consortia of such cells evolved and became the ancestor of all of today's animal diversity. In this scenario, the sponge lineage preserves many features of the animal ancestor on the branch leading to all other animals, including us. Specializations evolved that led to neurons, nerves and muscles and guts and all those things that we know and love as the defining features of the rest of animal life. Sponges appear to be primitive, since they lack those features.\"The other candidate for earliest animal lineage is the group of comb jellies, popular animals in many aquariums. While they look superficially like jellyfish\u2014they often have a bell-like shape, although with two lobes, unlike jellyfish, and usually tentacles\u2014they are only distantly related. And while jellyfish squirt their way through the water, ctenophores propel themselves with eight rows of beating cilia arranged down their sides like combs. Along the California coast, a common ctenophore is the 1-inch-diameter sea gooseberry.Chromosomes to the rescueTo learn whether sponges or ctenophores were the earliest branch of animals, the new study relied on an unlikely feature: the organization of genes into chromosomes. Each species has a characteristic chromosome number\u2014humans have 23 pairs\u2014and a characteristic distribution of genes along chromosomes.Rokhsar, Simakov and collaborators had previously shown that the chromosomes of sponges, jellyfish and many other invertebrates carry similar sets of genes, despite more than half a billion years of independent evolution. This discovery suggested that chromosomes of many animals evolve slowly, and allowed the team to computationally reconstruct the chromosomes of the common ancestor of these diverse animals.But the chromosome structure of ctenophores was unknown until 2021, when Schultz\u2014then a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz\u2014and his co-advisers, Richard Green of UCSC and Steven Haddock of MBARI and UCSC, determined the chromosome structure of the ctenophore Hormiphora californiensis. It looked very different from those of other animals, which posed a puzzle, Rokhsar said.\"At first, we couldn't tell if ctenophore chromosomes were different from those of other animals simply because they'd just changed a lot over hundreds of millions of years,\" Rokhsar explained. \"Alternatively, they could be different because they branched off first, before all other animal lineages appeared. We needed to figure it out.\"The researchers joined forces to sequence the genomes of another comb jelly and sponge, as well as three single-celled creatures that are outside the animal lineage: a choanoflagellate, a filasterean amoeba and a fish parasite called an ichthyosporean. Rough genome sequences of these non-animals already existed, but they did not contain the critical information needed for chromosome-scale gene linkage: where they sit on the chromosome.A smoking gunRemarkably, when the team compared the chromosomes of these diverse animals and non-animals, they found that ctenophores and non-animals shared particular gene-chromosome combinations, while the chromosomes of sponges and other animals were rearranged in a distinctly different manner.\"That was the smoking gun\u2014we found a handful of rearrangements shared by sponges and non-ctenophore animals. In contrast, ctenophores resembled the non-animals. The simplest explanation is that ctenophores branched off before the rearrangements occurred,\" he said.\"The fingerprints of this ancient evolutionary event are still present in the genomes of animals hundreds of millions of years later,\" Schultz said. \"This research ... gives us context for understanding what makes animals animals. This work will help us understand the basic functions we all share, like how they sense their surroundings, how they eat and how they move.\"Rokhsar emphasized that the team's conclusions are robustly based on five sets of gene-chromosome combinations.\"We found a relic of a very ancient chromosomal signal,\" he said. \"It took some statistical detective work to convince ourselves that this really is a clear signal and not just random noise, because we're dealing with relatively small groups of genes and perhaps a billion years of divergence between the animals and non-animals. But the signal is there and strongly supports the 'ctenophore-branched-first' scenario. The only way the alternative sponge-first hypothesis could be true would be if multiple convergent rearrangements happened in both sponges and non-ctenophore animals, which is very unlikely.\" More information:Darrin Schultz, Ancient gene linkages support ctenophores as sister to other animals, Nature (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the ant-mimicking spider?",
    "text": "A species of tiny, colorful jumping spider employs two lines of defense to avoid being eaten: camouflaging with plants and walking like an ant. Researchers report May 17 in the journal iScience that this combination of camouflage and movement mimicry helps the spiders evade spider-eating spiders but does not deter hungry praying mantises.          Mimicking ants is a good defense option because they do not make for good eating; ants often have spiny defenses and biting mandibles (and they're not afraid to fight back), and many also carry chemical repellants or venom. Though the focal spider of this study\u2014Siler collingwoodi\u2014was already known to move in an ant-like fashion, the researchers wanted to know how accurate its mimicry is, whether it mimics more than one ant species, and how effective this mimicry is at discouraging predators.The research team also explored the role of the spider's brilliant coloration. \"Unlike typical ant-mimicking spiders that mimic the brown or black body color of ants, S. collingwoodi has brilliant body coloration,\" says first author Hua Zeng, an ecologist at Peking University. \"From a human's perspective, it seems to blend well with plants in its environment, but we wanted to test whether their body coloration served as camouflage to protect against predators.\"To understand how ant-mimicry helps these spiders avoid being eaten, the researchers collected wild ant-mimicking spiders from four geographic locations in southern Hainan, China, and brought them back to the lab. For comparison, they also collected another type of jumping spider that doesn't mimic ants, as well as five co-occurring ant species that they thought might serve as models.Back in the lab, the researchers characterized and compared how the ants and spiders moved in terms of how they used individual limbs, as well as their speed, acceleration, and whether they followed a straight path or took a more tortuous trajectory.They found that, rather than jumping like most jumping spiders, S. collingwoodi move like ants: by raising their front legs to mimic an ant's antennae, bobbing their abdomens, and lifting their legs to walk in an ant-like manner. Of the five ant species, the spiders' walking style most closely resembled the three smaller ant species, who are also closer to it in size.                A photo of Siler collingwoodi, an ant-mimicking spider, on a flower. Credit: Yuchang Chen             \"S. collingwoodi is not necessarily a perfect mimic, because its gait and trajectory showed high similarity with multiple ant species,\" says Zeng. \"Being a general mimic rather than perfectly mimicking one ant species could benefit the spiders by allowing them to expand their range if the ant models occupy different habitats.\"      Next, the researchers tested the spider's defenses against two likely predators: a similarly sized jumping spider with color vision that specializes in preying upon other spiders (Portia labiata) and a praying mantis (Gonypeta brunneri) that is a generalist predator with a monochromatic visual system.To explore the role of color camouflage, the researchers modeled how the two predators would perceive S. collingwoodi relative to the other prey species against the background of two plants that the spiders live on\u2014the red-flowering West Indian jasmine (Ixora chinensis) and the Fukien tea tree (Carmona microphylla). They found that the ant-mimicking spiders were better camouflaged from both spider and praying mantis predators on the jasmine plant than the tea tree plant.When the predators were given the choice of the ant-mimicking spider and the other jumping spider, the predatory spider was more likely to attack the non-mimic; out of 17 trials, the spider launched five attacks, all of which were towards the non-mimic. Praying mantises, however, attacked both prey species with equal alacrity.\"We initially thought that both predators would behave similarly in the antipredation experiments, but in fact the simulated ant locomotion of Siler collingwoodi only worked for the jumping spider predator, while the praying mantis showed indiscriminate attacks on both ants and mimics,\" says senior author Wei Zhang, an evolutionary ecologist at Peking University.This difference might be driven by each predator's likelihood of being injured from eating an ant. The praying mantises are much larger than their prey, so they can get away with eating spiny ants without risking grave injury, but this is not the case for the predatory spiders.                A graphical abstract that explains how the jumping spider Siler collingwoodi mimicks the way ants walk to avoid being eaten. The spiders are also brightly colored, which may help them to camouflage with plants. Credit: Zeng et al             \"For the spider predator, a random attack on an ant could result in injury, so they are very careful predators and will only attack if they can distinguish S. collingwoodi from ants with a high degree of certainty,\" says Zhang.However, losing a limb compromised the ant-mimicking spiders' ability to avoid the predatory spider's attention, probably by preventing them from accurately mimicking ants.

    "question_squad": " What is the oldest eurypterid found in China?",
    "text": "Eurypterids (Arthropoda: Chelicerata), normally known as sea scorpions, are an important extinct group of Paleozoic chelicerate arthropods.          Researchers led by Profs. Zhang Haichun, Wang Bo, Zhang Yuandong, and Ph.D. student Wang Han from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGPAS), in collaboration with their colleagues from the U.K., have described a new Ordovician eurypterid, Archopterus anjiensis, from the latest Ordovcian (Hirnantian) Anji Biota of Zhejiang Province, South China. It represents the first unequivocal Ordovician eurypterid recorded in China as well as the oldest one ever found in the country, adding new knowledge to the early evolution of eurypterids in Gondwana.The study was published in the Journal of Paleontology on May 10.Eurypterids first appeared in the Ordovician, attained their maximum diversity during the late Silurian and early Devonian, and became extinct at the end of Permian. With bizarre morphology and high ecological diversity, they occupied marine, freshwater, and even terrestrial environments, becoming an important medium for us to understand the transition of ecological environments in the Paleozoic.However, Ordovician eurypterids are extremely rare. To date, only 12 species of Ordovician eurypterids are known in the world, so any reported occurrence is of great significance to understanding their early evolutionary history.                Fossils of Archopterus anjiensis. Credit: NIGPAS             The current study reported a rare Ordovician eurypterid from the Wenchang Formation of Anji County, Zhejiang Province.\"Archopterus anjiensis is characterized by a parabolic carapace, Hughmilleria-type prosomal appendages, vase-shaped metastoma, and a three-segmented type A (female) genital appendage, estimated to be 15 cm long,\" said Wang Han, first author of the study.Associated with diverse sponges, Archopterus anjiensis was found in a deep-water environment at a depth of several hundred meters. This occurrence, along with some Ordovician eurypterids from a normal marine environment, may indicate that some early eurypterids favored living in deeper waters than their post-Ordovician relatives.In addition, Archopterus anjiensis represents the oldest adelophthalmid and extends the stratigraphic range of this family to the Late Ordovician (by about 10 million years), making Adelophthalmidae the longest-living eurypterid family (Ordovician to Permian), and indicates that adelophthalmids have been found in the widest range of habitats of all eurypterid groups.This rare Ordovician sea scorpion from Zhejiang Province, along with continuous discoveries of eurypterid fossils in China, indicates that there is great potential for exploration of eurypterids in Paleozoic Gondwana areas.

    "text": "Plants, like humans, need to move sugar and other nutrients around their bodies to power their growth. But unlike humans, they do not have a heart to pump these vital nutrients. Instead, they use an amazing molecular pump mechanism that scientists have been studying for decades since its discovery more than 30 years ago.          Now, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Bj\u00f8rn P. Pedersen at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Aarhus University has made a groundbreaking discovery about the SUC transporter, one of the most important components of this pump mechanism. This molecule is like a microscopic sugar delivery truck that actively loads a type of sugar called sucrose (tabletop sugar) into the plant's \"veins,\" which are called the phloem.Until now, scientists have struggled to understand exactly how this transporter works. But the team's new research has uncovered the secrets behind how the SUC transporter recognizes sucrose and how it uses acid to power its sugar delivery. The results have been published in Nature Plants.\"This discovery is a breakthrough because it finally solves a long-standing mystery: how plants are able to sustain the loading of sucrose into the 'veins' and create the turgor pressure that generates the flow of all nutrients in the phloem,\" says Pedersen. \"This is like the plant's 'heart' and it's critical for the plant's survival and growth.\"The team's work also sheds new light on how plants defend themselves from pests. When plants are under attack, pests try to steal the sugar in the phloem.

    "text": "Assemblies of tiny molecular proteins span the membranes that encapsulate our cells, directing cellular activities and regulating the transport of materials and information in and out.          In the fight against human disease, including various cancers and neurocognitive disorders, more than 60% of market drugs target these membrane proteins.But a lack of technology has hampered scientists' efforts to capture key information about these proteins where they live, requiring the use of artificial chemical environments.In an important breakthrough, scientists at the Yale Nanobiology Institute have decoded a chemical signal that allows them to capture these biological interactions directly from their natural habitat.The finding, published in Nature Methods, opens up new avenues for understanding downstream cellular applications in human health.\"The traditional way to analyze these membrane proteins was to put them into an artificial environment, but that was a lot like studying a fish out of water,\" said Kallol Gupta, assistant professor of cell biology and lead author of the study.Previous experiments relied on the \"brute force\" energy of conventional mass spectrometry techniques to remove proteins from their greasy membrane environments. But this damaged the proteins and their ability to bind with other molecules\u2014including, crucially, those of potential therapeutic value.The team at Yale's West Campus identified a class of chemicals, called superchargers, that worked to gently destabilize the membrane while leaving the embedded proteins intact. They were then able to show how cell membranes regulate the speed of neurotransmitter release, a key step in central nervous system signaling.This breakthrough technology opens the way for scientists to screen future therapeutics precisely and directly at the point where proteins encounter new drugs.Aniruddha Panda, a postdoctoral researcher in the Gupta Lab, was the first author of the study, which included collaborators at the Rothman Lab, Yale Nanobiology Institute, the University of Oxford, Aarhus University, Texas Tech University and Sorbonne Universit\u00e9. Alongside an in-house mass spectrometer, the authors also utilized the West Campus Analytical Core and the Imaging Core in their experiments.

    "text": "The link between air pollution and lung disease has long been recognized. Now a new USC study reveals one biological process that may be behind that link\u2014a discovery which could provide new insights on better ways to treat or prevent diseases related to pollution exposure.          \"We know that diseases, especially lung diseases, can result from air pollution exposure. What we don't know are the mechanisms by which that occurs,\" said Edward Crandall, Ph.D., MD, professor of pathology, member of the Hastings Center for Pulmonary Research and director of the Will Rogers Institute Pulmonary Research Center at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.In their research, Crandall and his team discovered a key step along the path between air pollution exposure and disease. Exposure to ambient nanoparticles, or very small pollutants in the air, limits the ability of cells to defend themselves against other potential harms. The findings were published in the journal Autophagy Reports.Crandall, the study's senior author, and his colleagues studied a cellular defense process known as autophagy, which cells use to destroy damaged or abnormal internal materials. For the first time, the researchers found that, when exposed to nanoparticles, autophagy activity in cells seems to reach an upper threshold.\"The implication of these studies is that autophagy is a defense mechanism that has an upper limit, beyond which it can't defend the cell any further,\" Crandall said.An upper thresholdThe researchers conducted a series of tests using lung adenocarcinoma cells. They first exposed the cells to nanoparticles, then to rapamycin (a chemical known to stimulate autophagy), then to both nanoparticles and rapamycin. In every case, autophagy activity reached the same upper threshold and did not increase further.Consequently, cells may lack the ability to further boost autophagy to defend against other dangers, such as smoke inhalation or a viral or bacterial infection. This may help explain why air pollution increases a person's risk for a number of acute and chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.As part of the research, Crandall and his team also developed a new method of studying autophagy, which can support future studies on the subject. They used a combination of fluorescent dyes and a powerful imaging method, known as confocal microscopy, to document the amount of autophagy taking place inside individual cells.\"What's special is that we can now measure the autophagic activity of single living cells in real time. It's a novel method for studying autophagy,\" said Arnold Sipos, MD, Ph.D., assistant professor of research pathology at the Keck School of Medicine and the study's first author.More research on autophagyThe new findings can help support ongoing research on autophagy, including for cancer treatment. While autophagy is a boon for healthy cells, it makes cancer cells harder to destroy. Developing methods to raise or lower autophagy in cells could be a key way to protect against and treat disease.\"The more we know about the mechanisms by which diseases occur, the more opportunity we have to find places in the pathway where we can intervene and prevent or treat the disease,\" Crandall said.Next, Crandall, Sipos and their colleagues will conduct further research to test whether adding nanoparticles to a cell directly increases its vulnerability to other threats, such as an infection. They plan to study the link in both healthy cells and cancer cells.

    "text": "A study of eelgrass meadows planted by researchers from the University of Gothenburg shows that fauna return rapidly once the eelgrass has started to grow. Already after the second summer, the biodiversity in the planted meadow was almost the same as in old established eelgrass meadows.          Eelgrass meadows have declined heavily in southern Bohus county in recent decades and in many places have disappeared altogether. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have been working on the restoration of eelgrass meadows for twelve years. These meadows are important for biodiversity, as the eelgrass serves as habitat or nursery for young cod, crabs and shrimps for example.In a new study, the researchers have evaluated how rapidly replanted eelgrass gets populated by various invertebrates. The study has been going on for over two years in a bay near G\u00e5s\u00f6 island just west of Skaft\u00f6 in Bohus county, and the findings are very positive. The researchers counted the abundance of invertebrates that live or burrow in bottom sediments or on the surface of bottom sediments.Size less important\"The recolonization has been very rapid. After the first three-month growing season, up to 80 percent of the invertebrates had returned to the newly planted eelgrass,\" says Eduardo Infantes, marine biologist at the University of Gothenburg.                Comparison of new planted eelgrass and a plot that was planted 15 months ago. Credit: Eduardo Infantes             During the summer in 2019, the researchers planted the eelgrass shoots in four test plots of different sizes on the seabed, and with different spacing between the shoots. According to the researchers' observations in autumn 2020, size has played less of a role in the recovery of biodiversity in the eelgrass meadows.In fact, even if the eelgrass has not had time to grow to the same density as in an established eelgrass meadow, the biodiversity is similar after only two growing seasons as in a reference area of preserved eelgrass in the same bay. Even smaller patches embedded within larger restoration plots showed good results.Their findings were reported in the journal Restoration Ecology.Can save money\"This is good news for future restorations and new plantings of eelgrass meadows. We can plant new smaller plots with fewer shoots and this saves money because this is an expensive method for restoring biodiversity on the seabed,\" says Eduardo Infantes.Eelgrass meadows have multiple functions that make it imperative to protect them. In addition to their important role in the coastal ecosystem, eelgrass roots bind the sediment and prevent erosion and limit resuspension of sediment in the water.

    "text": "A new study from North Carolina State University finds carrying pollen is a workout that significantly increases the body temperature of bumble bees. This new understanding of active bumble bee body temperatures raises questions about how these species will be impacted by a warmer world due to climate change.          Spend a bit of time at a nearby flower patch and you will spot a fuzzy bumble bee with yellow bumps on her back legs. These yellow bumps are solid packets of pollen that have been carefully collected during the bees' foraging trip for transport back to their nests.And while bees may seem to move from flower to flower with ease, these pollen packets can weigh up to a third of their body weight. This new study found that\u2014after accounting for environmental temperature and body size\u2014the body temperature of bumble bees carrying pollen was significantly hotter than the temperature of bees that were empty-legged.Specifically, the researchers found that bee body temperatures rose 0.07\u00b0C for every milligram of pollen that they carried, with fully laden bees being 2\u00b0C warmer than unladen bees.Like ants and other ectotherms, the body temperature of a bumble bee is mostly determined by the environment. Among bees, bumble bees are exceptionally cold tolerant and will shiver to warm up during cold days. However, not much is known about how they can tolerate heat.Since pollen-laden bumble bees are hotter than unladen ones, this could mean that carrying a full load of pollen on a hot day puts bees at greater risk of reaching the potentially lethal end of their temperature tolerance.\"Getting warmer from carrying pollen could put bumble bees in the range of those stressful, critically hot temperatures,\" says Malia Naumchik, a former applied ecology minor undergraduate and lead author of the study. \"This has important implications for bumble bees and climate change. As environmental temperatures increase, the bees' operational range of temperatures could shrink significantly.\"Bumble bee numbers and species diversity is on the decline across the world, particularly in areas that are warming up due to climate change. But the exact mechanics of how climate change is impacting bumble bees are not yet fully understood. This finding could be one piece of that puzzle.Pollen is crucial for every stage of a bumble bee's life history. Newly emerged queens in the spring need to feed themselves and then feed their sister workers. Those workers then take over feeding the colony, larvae and future queens. Without pollen, or enough pollen, colonies will not thrive\u2014risking future colonies and the species as a whole. This may also have implications for pollination in general, and could impact agriculture and ecosystems alike.\"We need to know how bumble bees may change their behavior, to better understand how this could affect how much pollen they collect and how much pollination they perform during hot days,\" says Elsa Youngsteadt, a professor in applied ecology and supervisor of Malia's research.\"Whether it's carrying smaller loads of pollen or foraging for shorter times, it could result in less pollen coming to the colony and fewer plants being pollinated. This is particularly important since bumble bees provide critical ecosystem services and are key pollinators for agriculture, especially in the United States and Europe.\"The paper, \"Larger pollen loads increase risk of heat stress in foraging bumblebees\" is published in Biology Letters.

    "text": "Irritator challengeri was a two-legged, meat-eating dinosaur, or more precisely\u2014a spinosaurid. The knowledge of the species is based on the most complete fossil skull known from this group. With the aid of X-ray computed tomographs usually used in the context of medicine or material science, paleontologists from Greifswald, Munich (both Germany), Alkmaar (Netherlands) and Fribourg (Switzerland) thoroughly investigated the fossil and made astonishing discoveries.          In what is now Brazil, it is presumed that Irritator hunted relatively small prey with a strongly inclined snout that evolved to close quickly. A big surprise for the experts: when the hunter opened its muzzle, the lower jaws spread out to the sides, widening the throat region. The study was published in Palaeontologia Electronica.Marco Schade has worked with dinosaur fossils for several years. The creatures he investigates became extinct millions of years ago and mostly incomplete fossils are all that is left of them. The remains of extinct organisms are often housed\u2014as in this case, in the Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Stuttgart\u2014in public collections and sometimes provide unexpected insights into life on our planet in times that have long since passed.Spinosaurids are among the largest land-dwelling predators to have ever lived on Earth. Their peculiar anatomy and sparse fossil record make spinosaurids mysterious in comparison to other large-bodied carnivorous dinosaurs. Spinosaurids bear relatively long and slender snouts with numerous near-conical teeth, sturdy arms with impressive claws and very long processes on their spines.The most complete fossil skull of a spinosaurid is represented by Irritator challengeri found in approx. 115 Ma old sedimentary rocks from eastern Brazil. While the species, being estimated to have reached some 6.5 m in body length, represents the largest animal in its ecosystem, paleontologists also found fossils from other dinosaurs, pterosaurs, relatives of crocodiles, turtles and diverse fish species there.For their latest study, the scientists reconstructed every single skull bone of the fossil and put them together in their original position to find out what makes spinosaurids so special. With the aid of CT data, they found that Irritator probably held its snout around 45\u00b0 inclined in situations that required close attention to its surroundings. This position facilitated an area of three-dimensional vision to the front, since no structures, such as the long muzzle, obstructed the field of view being produced by both eyes.Furthermore, the skull of Irritator was evolutionarily shaped in a way that produced a relatively weak but very fast bite. Due to the shape of the lower jaw joint, when this predator opened its mouth, the lower jaws spread out to the sides, which widened the pharynx. This is somewhat similar to what is displayed by pelicans, but achieved by different biomechanical processes. These are hints for Irritator's preference for relatively small items of prey, including fish, which were snapped up and heavily injured with speedy jaw movements in order to swiftly swallow them whole.Verified spinosaurid fossils all come from the Early and Late Cretaceous period and encompass approx. 35 million years, which also corresponds with the length of time that separates spinosaurids from other large predatory dinosaurs in respect to their evolutionary history. The study allows new insights into the lifestyle of spinosaurids and shows that\u2014in relation to their closer relatives\u2014they acquired many new anatomical features in a geologically short amount of time, which eventually made them the highly specialized and exceptional dinosaurs we know today.

    "text": "Despite their intimidating appearance, the giant yellow and blue-black spiders spreading across the Southeastern U.S. owe their survival to a surprising trait: They're rather timid.          According to a new study from the University of Georgia, the Jor\u014d (Joro) spider may be the shyest spider ever documented.\"One of the ways that people think this spider could be affecting other species is that it's aggressive and out-competing all the other native spiders,\" said Andy Davis, lead author of the study and a research scientist in UGA's Odum School of Ecology. \"So we wanted to get to know the personality of these spiders and see if they're capable of being that aggressive.\"It turns out they're not.\"The researchers compared more than 450 spiders' responses to a brief and harmless disturbance across 10 different species.While most spiders froze for less than a minute before resuming their normal activities, the Joro spiders remained motionless for more than an hour.\"They basically shut down and wait for the disturbance to go away,\" Davis said. \"Our paper shows that these spiders are really more afraid of you than the reverse.\"In fact, Joros are relatively harmless to people and pets. Joros won't bite unless cornered. And even if you did manage to somehow annoy a Joro into biting you, its fangs likely wouldn't be large enough to pierce your skin.Most spiders begin moving quickly after stress, Joros remain immobile for 60-plus minutesTo examine the spiders' reaction to stress, the researchers used a turkey baster to gently blow two rapid puffs of air onto individual spiders. This minor disturbance causes the spiders to \"freeze\" for a period of time, going absolutely still.The researchers tested more than 30 garden spiders, banded garden spiders and marbled orb weavers. They also analyzed similar data from previously published, peer-reviewed papers that assessed the response of 389 more spiders, comprising five additional species.All of those spiders began moving again after an average of about a minute and half of stillness.The Joros, however, stayed frozen with no body or leg movement for over an hour in most cases.The only other spider species that exhibited a similarly extended response was the Joro spider's cousin, the golden silk spider. Known as Trichonephila clavipes, the golden silk spider and the Joro spider are from the same genus.      Joros may be invasive, but they're not aggressiveOfficially known as Trichonephila clavata, the East Asian Joro spider first arrived in Georgia around 2013. The species is native to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China, and likely hitched a ride stateside on a shipping container.The species has since rapidly spread across the state and much of the Southeast. Joro spiders easily number in the millions now. And there's not much we can do to stop them from increasing their range.Davis' previous research even suggested the invasive arachnids could spread beyond their current habitats and through most of the Eastern Seaboard.\"Most people think 'invasive' and 'aggressive' are synonymous,\" said Amitesh Anerao, co-author of the study and an undergraduate researcher at the university. \"People were freaking out about the Joro spiders at first, but maybe this paper can help calm people down.\"Joro spiders built to withstand human activityJoros are regularly spotted in areas native Georgia spiders don't typically inhabit.They build their golden webs between powerlines, on top of stoplights and even above the pumps at local gas stations\u2014none of which are particularly peaceful spots.The researchers believe the Joro spiders' shyness may help them better endure the barrage of noise, vibrations and visual stimuli they consistently encounter in urban settings. Their prolonged freeze response to being startled could help conserve the Joro spiders' energy.If you're wondering how something so mild-mannered could spread the way Joro spiders have, you aren't the only one.\"One thing this paper tells me is that the Joros' rapid spread must be because of their incredible reproductive potential,\" Davis said. \"They're simply outbreeding everybody else. It's not because they're displacing native spiders or kicking them out of their own webs.\"Arachnophobes can take solace in the Joro spiders' meek and gentle temperament. But the spiders are likely here to stay.\"They're so good at living with humans,\" Anerao said, \"that they're probably not going away anytime soon.\"The work is published in the journal Arthropoda.

    "question_squad": " What is the process by which founder cells develop into specialized cells in floral meristems called?",
    "text": "The intricate process of flower development has long fascinated scientists seeking to unravel the mysteries behind nature's precision timing. In a study published in the journal The Plant Cell, a research team led by Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan has shed light on the inner workings of floral meristem termination and stamen development, uncovering a unique mechanism driven by the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors.          Flowers owe their intricate structures to delicate stem cell differentiation, a process by which founder cells develop into specialized cells in floral meristems. However, the precise moment at which stem cells cease self-renewal and transform into their form remains largely unknown. Driven by a desire to decipher this critical temporal transition, the researchers turned their attention to AGAMOUS (AG), a pivotal MADS domain transcription factor governing floral meristem termination.Through meticulous investigations in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the team discovered that AG serves as a master conductor, orchestrating gene expression through a process known as cell cycle-coupled H3K27me3 dilution. This remarkable phenomenon involves the dilution of a histone modification called H3K27me3 along specific gene sequences, effectively kickstarting gene activation. The scientists identified several key genes directly regulated by AG at various time points of this cycle.The study revealed a genetic network tightly controlled by AG, with genes such as KNUCKLES (KNU), AT HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIZED PROTEIN18 (AHL18), and PLATZ10 emerging as critical players. \"By unraveling the inner workings of this regulatory circuit, we gained unprecedented insight into the intricate timing mechanisms that drive proper floral meristem termination and stamen development,\" says first author Margaret Anne Pelayo.To unlock the secrets of this remarkable system, the researchers devised a mathematical model capable of predicting gene expression timing with astonishing accuracy. By modifying the length of H3K27me3-marked regions within the genes, they successfully demonstrated that gene activation could be delayed or reduced, confirming the influence of this epigenetic timer. The team's findings offer a novel perspective on how nature controls the gene expression during flower development.Furthermore, their study identified AHL18 as a stamen-specific gene with a profound impact on stamen growth and development. Misexpression of AHL18 led to intriguing developmental defects, highlighting the gene's vital role in ensuring proper stamen elongation and maturation. Additionally, the team discovered that AHL18 selectively binds to genes crucial for stamen growth, uncovering a new layer of regulatory complexity in flower development.Nobutoshi Yamaguchi, senior author of the study, opined that this research not only deepens our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning floral development but also presents a potential tool for fine tuning gene expression patterns. Manipulating the delicate balance of epigenetic modifications opens up exciting possibilities for controlling plant reproduction in a flexible and reversible manner, ultimately benefiting our food supply and agricultural practices.This study paves the way for further exploration of epigenetic approaches to regulate gene expression with exquisite precision. By unraveling nature's perfect clock, scientists may one day unlock new strategies for enhancing crop productivity and bolstering plant resilience, and contribute to food security despite environmental challenges.

    "text": "Tomatoes, bananas, cabbages, melons, pumpkins and cucumbers\u2026 are just some of the 150 crops of commercial interest that are victims of Fusarium oxysporum, one of the most important pathogens in the world due to the millions of dollars in losses it is responsible for and its ability to attack different types of plants. Although it can go unnoticed in the soil for more than 30 years, when it detects the roots of a host plant, it grows towards them, colonizing its vascular system and causing crops to wilt.          The application of fungicides, rotation, and the development of resistant varieties are some of the agricultural practices that have proven to be insufficient to control it, due to its high adaptability. Now, the Fungal Pathogenesis Molecular Genetics research group at the University of Cordoba has managed to attenuate the virulence of the pathogen by developing a new strategy: genetically altering a cellular pathway, making it 'believe' that it has the necessary resources without the need to infect crops.The key: 'Confusing' the fungusWhat would happen if an individual in need of food received a series of chemical signals indicating to him that, on the contrary, he was satiated and had sufficient resources? This is, despite the obvious differences, the approach upon which the scientific work was based.\"For decades it has been hypothesized that nutrient starvation is a signal that triggers infection,\" explains researcher Manuel S\u00e1nchez, one of the authors of the study. Based on this premise, the study has eliminated a gene from the fungus, which codes for a protein called Tsc2. By eliminating this protein, according to the results of the study, it is possible to permanently activate a cellular pathway that is set in motion naturally when the pathogen has the necessary nutrients.\"It's like telling the fungus that it doesn't need resources, creating confusion,\" the researcher stressed. Despite the fact that the microorganism is in an environment in which it should set its infection mechanisms in motion, it receives a set of signals that tell it that it has the necessary nutrients to survive without needing to infect anything. In short, it is a matter of playing, genetically, with its hunger, a bit of chemical trickery.According to the results of the study, published in the journal Molecular Plant Pathology and carried out by means of infection tests on tomato plants, this genetically modified strain of Fusarium oxysporum reduces its capacity to penetrate and adhere to the root, thus attenuating its virulence.The work, in which the researchers Gasabel Yaneth Navarro Velasco and Antonio Di Pietro also participated, brings to the fore a medium- and long-term objective: to develop an antifungal strategy that replicates this response outside the laboratory.

    "text": "A wide range of plant species is essential to our Earth because of the different materials and foods these plants provide. But plant diversity has decreased drastically in recent decades. Ph.D. candidate Kaixuan Pan explains what we can do to increase it once again.          Twenty-two percent of insect-pollinated plants became extinct between 1930 and 2017. This was mainly due to climate change and intensive agriculture. Plant extinction is a huge problem because plants provide humans with an array of foods and materials and have an important role in many ecosystems.Pan's research shows that if we do not intervene, plants will continue to go extinct in the coming years. But he is optimistic: \"It's definitely extremely alarming information but at least we know now and can take action.\"What can we do to increase plant diversity? \"There are a number of options, ranging from the big to the small,\" says Pan. \"For example, the government should focus not only on protected areas but also on unprotected ones, where threatened plant species also grow. If we have a better idea of where these species live, we will be able to protect them in a much more efficient and targeted way.\"Another finding from Pan's research is that plants benefit from a mix of habitats rather than one habitat alone. \"A combination of woods, heathland and grass is better for plant diversity than just woods,\" says Pan. Another misconception, he adds, is that nature reserves have the most plant diversity. \"The green spaces in urban areas, like people's gardens, actually contain a wealth of different plant species, particularly the 'common' plant species. So we should continue to encourage people to make their gardens as diverse as possible.\"Other efforts are being made to raise public awareness about plant diversity: the National Bee Count, for example, which is organized by Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Eighty percent of the most important plants need insects to reproduce. In the National Bee Count, people can count bees in their own gardens.\"It's important to involve everyone because this problem will ultimately affect us all,\" says Pan. \"We therefore kill two birds with one stone: generating public awareness and collecting data on insects.\" The data is saved and used to map out where different species are found. The more knowledge there is about different species, the better they are to protect.Action taken to increase plant diversity can therefore range from the big to the small. Pan is glad that change is already afoot. The EU, for example, now requires businesses with more than 500 employees to be open about their impact on biodiversity. It is their duty to protect biodiversity. \"This is a significant step. Hopefully everyone will do their bit for biodiversity and therefore for our future.\" Provided byLeiden UniversityCitation:More plants will go extinct if we do nothing, says researcher (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-extinct.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "Cities provide important connections to nature as well as habitat for many species, according to new research in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.          Many people tend to think of cities as places devoid of nature, but a study by researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Auburn University and Rutgers University suggests that cities offer unique opportunities for wildlife conservation, not to mention the value that nature can have for human health and well-being.\"As a city kid growing up during the 1980s, I was fascinated with peregrine falcons that nested on high-rise buildings, and that experience is what sparked my interest in birds and nature,\" said co-author Frank La Sorte, a researcher at the Lab of Ornithology. \"Observing birds in cities gives us an opportunity to see nature as something that is part of our well-being and if we protect nature, in the end we are protecting ourselves.\"To document the value of cities to the bird themselves, the team combined bird observations made by citizen scientists to the Lab's eBird program; federal and state lists of threatened and endangered bird species in the United States; critical habitat designations for threatened and endangered species in the U.S.; and 2010 U.S. Census data.In the continental U.S., 38 bird species have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Seven of those species can be found in 81% of urbanized areas (390 out of 481) that have populations of more than 50,000. For the 618 bird species listed as threatened or endangered at the state level, 11% of them occur in urban areas in the states where they are listed.In some cases, natural areas within cities could mean increased access to resources, warmer temperatures or protection from natural disasters, all of which could benefit some species. The authors also suggest that natural areas in cities could provide important refugia, or allow for unique reintroduction opportunities for species where reintroduction is not possible in their natural habitat.The authors caution that cities don't always operate as safe spaces for wildlife. A particular city would need to have positive effects on the species for at least one part of their life cycle.\"If a species is drawn to a city, but doesn't fare well, that can be a problem,\" La Sorte said.When species are attracted to areas where they do poorly, scientists call that an \"ecological trap.\" Ensuring that cities are not ecological traps, through measures such as Lights Out programs and greenspace initiatives, is an important part of making a city a truly safe space for wildlife.\"If you want to understand what's happening with bird populations, you need data across the entire landscape,\" La Sorte said. \"Rock pigeons, for example, are not well represented in eBird data because we don't get many checklists from core urban areas, but that kind of information is valuable.\"Reframing our views of cities as places where we can connect with nature, the authors said, is a key to stemming biodiversity loss. Many cities are creating more opportunities for people to engage with nature, which may lead to greater environmental stewardship. Citizen science programs such as eBird, they said, have the potential to transform this engagement into real opportunities for advancing science and conservation.

    "text": "New research using remote sensing technology has delivered promising results to scientists looking for innovative ways to help nurseries combat the spread of myrtle rust.          Scientists at Crown Research Institute Scion have found a way to quickly detect myrtle rust days before plants show signs of infection, providing hope that nurseries in the future can start control treatment much sooner and stop disease outbreaks in their tracks.Working in a containment laboratory, the Scion team, led by data scientist Elizaveta Graevskaya, used high precision equipment to detect myrtle rust infection in leaves of rose apple deliberately inoculated with the myrtle rust pathogen. The work is published in the journal Phytopathology.Using thermal imaging the team detected decreases in leaf temperature in infected plants at least a day before symptoms could be seen. Transpiration measurements showed the temperature drop was caused by higher rates of water evaporation from the leaves as the fungal infection punctures individual cells, which cooled the leaves down.The researchers also used a hyperspectral sensor to look at changes in the wavelength of light reflected from infected leaves. Measurements made using hyperspectral cameras can include visible light to shortwave infrared and have proved particularly useful for early detection of diseases. For example, the ratio of blue/green light reflected by infected leaves was noticeably different from healthy leaves up to three days before symptoms were visible. This change suggests that myrtle rust reduces the amount of chlorophyll in infected leaves. Chlorophyll is the green pigment that gives leaves their color, and which absorbs energy from the sun during photosynthesis.These exciting results have prompted the team to expand their research to include other vulnerable species from the myrtle family, starting with eucalyptus in spring.The lead author of this research and Scion Principal Scientist Mike Watt presented the findings as part of a webinar series delivered by Beyond Myrtle Rust\u2014a collaborative research program that Scion contributes to.\"This sophisticated technology has allowed us to detect myrtle rust infection before it can be seen visually in leaves,\" Dr. Watt says. \"We hope this research can be used to develop a robust detection methodology that will benefit commercial nurseries in the future.\"      Scion pathologists, who are some of New Zealand's leading experts in myrtle rust, have been involved in research to understand the impact of the disease since it was first detected in mainland New Zealand in 2017.While myrtle rust will be impossible to eradicate, Scion forest geneticist Heidi Dungey says this latest research is a major step towards arming nurseries with the tools they need to make better disease management decisions.\"We are several years away yet, but we can see a time when nurseries will be using hand-held, mobile technology that will be able to detect myrtle rust infections before they are visible,\" Dr. Dungey says.The technology also has potential to be used in the field, and at a much larger scale.Because the thermal and hyperspectral equipment used by the Scion researchers can be mounted on drones, the team hopes to one day develop field-based methods to detect myrtle rust infections rapidly and remotely.Forest pathologist and research group leader Stuart Fraser leads the Ecology and Environment team investigating myrtle rust. He describes the latest research as \"incredibly promising.\"\"As part of a wider program of research, we've been monitoring myrtle rust's impact and seasonal progression across the North Island for several years,\" he says.\"It's important that we throw everything at it and use a range of available technologies to accelerate research and management, so we can reduce myrtle rust damage to our most vulnerable plants and landscapes.\"Myrtle rust poses a threat to the country's most iconic plants, including p\u014dhutakawa, m\u0101nuka, and r\u0101t\u0101, as well as commercially grown species such as eucalyptus.Currently, myrtle rust has an uneven distribution across the North Island, and on the top part of the South Island. It has also been reported from Christchurch. It is most likely to be seen during warm, wet conditions.The disease causes bright yellow-orange powdery pustules on young leaves, shoots, fruits and flowers in the myrtle family, causing deformation of the leaves, and twig dieback. Repeated severe infection can cause decline or death of large trees.Beyond Myrtle Rust program leader Mahajabeen Padamsee says the research illustrates how technology is an important tool for the detection and monitoring of plant pathogens, which is vital for disease management.

    "text": "In the animal kingdom, sibling conflicts \u2014mostly in the form of competition for food from parents \u2014are fairly common in birds. Sometimes death can occur as a result of this competition, but siblicide almost always occurs when young are still in the nest.          Conflicts among siblings suggest a trade-off between competition for resources and the benefits of having blood relatives. In many species, despite sibling conflicts, juveniles have the choice to stay within the home territory or leave and seek out a new home.But Canada jay siblings will fight one another for their home territory after leaving the nest. If they lose, they must leave.My colleagues and I compared the survival and reproductive benefits of being the dominant juvenile, while taking into account the costs related to kicking out closely related siblings. Published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, this study on sibling conflict in wild animals is the first to measure the cost of kicking out siblings. The cost of kicking out close relatives is that individuals that might help spread the family genes are instead sentenced to exile, where they have a high probability of dying.Canada jay behaviorUsing six years of radio-tracking data and our 50 years of data on individually marked Canada jays in Algonquin Provincial Park in central Ontario, we were interested in whether the benefit of kicking out your siblings outweighed the cost.To do this, we examined the survival and lifetime reproductive success of all known dominant juveniles and ejectees. Because Canada jays can live up to 17 years, it took over five decades to collect lifetime data on a sufficient number of individuals in the population.Canada jays are full-time residents of North America's boreal forests, and they rely on stored food items to survive through the winter. They are only one of two known species (the other being the closely related Siberian jay) in which sibling conflicts result in expulsion of one or more siblings from the home territory after juveniles have left the nest.About six weeks after offspring have left the nest but still remain in the home territory being fed by parents, an intense battle commences. The end result is the ejection of weaker siblings (ejectees) from the home territory by the dominant juvenile. By being forced out, ejectees must find a new home before the onset of winter.We found that while dominant juveniles do incur a cost of kicking out their siblings, the benefits of higher first-year survival and long-term reproductive success outweigh the costs of sibling expulsion.                Young Canada jays fight to keep their siblings out of the parents\u2019 territory. Credit: M. Fuirst, Author provided             Winner takes allThe decision to kick ejectees out of the home territory has a tremendous trade-off for Canada jays. Our research found that by remaining as the sole offspring at home, a dominant juvenile has a higher probability of survival in their first year and more successful reproduction in adulthood.This is likely because the dominant juvenile does not need to find a new place to live, is able to live in a group in the first year of its life and is already familiar with the habitat where they can store food for the winter.And while the dominant juvenile reaps those benefits, ejectees are sentenced to a risky first year of life, where they are less likely to survive.It is not necessarily a beneficial thing to kill or expel a sibling, even if the ability is there. Siblings share genes, so harming a sibling has a negative effect on the genetic success of an individual's lineage. However, in the animal world, such behaviors come down to costs and benefits.If, by monopolizing resources in the nest, a sibling is able to gain a lifetime benefit that outweighs the cost it would otherwise incur by sharing resources, then the trait would be considered adaptive and likely spread in the population over time.In the case of Canada jays, the expelled siblings don't all die. Our research found that although ejectees have lower survival rates over their first summer, most that survive are adopted by unrelated adults. We saw juveniles with parents who did not have young of their own. A smaller proportion found a mate to breed in their first year or remained alone.Sibling behavior and survivalIn Algonquin Provincial Park, the number of Canada jay territories has declined by over 75 percent in the last four decades. This trend is due to warming temperatures and higher frequencies of freeze-thaw events that spoil the highly perishable food that jays store for winter.Our study is important for the field of behavioral ecology, and it provides novel insights into the evolutionary drivers of sibling conflicts. With the Algonquin Park jay population in major decline, understanding the behaviors of Canada jays is essential to understand the challenges individuals may be facing to survive.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the project that investigated bees' gut health?",
    "text": "Awareness is growing worldwide of the crucial role that bees and other pollinators play in preserving natural habitats and securing food supplies. In the run-up to World Bee Day on 20 May, Horizon Magazine takes a closer look at how microorganisms in a bee gut are key to ensuring the insects'\u2014and the planet's\u2014future.          With three-quarters of global food crops depending on pollinators to some extent, ensuring the well-being of these resourceful insects as they confront habitat loss, pollution and pesticides will be central to improving food provisions in years to come.Easy honeybeeFor bees as well as humans, a healthy digestive tract could go a long way towards enhancing longevity. That's why researchers are studying the mysterious inner microbiome in bees' guts to learn more about their resistance to diseases and how best to protect against sickness.\"The gut microbiota is important for protecting bees against pathogens,\" said Dr. Am\u00e9lie Cabirol, a postdoctoral researcher in honeybee health at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. \"We need to understand all the determinants of the bee's physiology to be able to say 'This is the ID card of a healthy bee.\"'In the world of honeybees, average lifespans can range from eight weeks to five years depending on the type of bee. Worker bees die within months while queen bees can live for years.A honeybee's gut is relatively straightforward to study because it is dominated by specialized communities of only around nine bacterial species. That means they could serve as a good basis for learning more about microbiome in other species too, including humans.Some pesticides and herbicides affect the gut microbiota of bees. Pesticides called neonicotinoids have often been implicated in pollinator declines. While their use outdoors was banned in the EU in 2018, exemptions have been granted before recent attempts to end the practice.Changes to what's in a bee's gut aren't always lethal but can still hamper the ability to pollinate.      Bacteria-memory link\"There is growing evidence that having a disturbed gut microbiota will impact on bees' learning and memory performance,\" said Cabirol. \"Such cognitive abilities are important for bees to associate odors with nectar they get from flowers and therefore remember the best food sources in their environment.\"The HarmHoney project that she worked on investigated bee gut health using genetic sequencing and the study of small molecules involved in metabolism within cells. The initiative ran from May 2020 until October 2022.Cabirol's team found that honeybees learned and memorized information better when their gut contained five types of core bacteria than when they contained just one or none.That suggests performance is improved by interactions between microbe types. The next step will be to test various combinations to pinpoint what's happening.\"Now, we can only say that each microbial member on its own is not sufficient to promote these cognitive abilities, but we cannot yet say if every member is necessary for this,\" said Cabirol.Although recent research suggests honeybees have been on the rise over the past decades, she said that individual colonies can still suffer severe losses and hopes that HarmHoney's findings can be applied to other threatened bee species.For example, studies carried out by her colleagues at the University of Lausanne have started to unravel more about the diversity in the gut microbiomes of so-called stingless bees.The relative ease of studying honeybees as a result of factors like their widespread global presence makes them good test cases, according to Cabirol.\"Honeybee colony losses raise the alarm that other non-managed bee populations may be suffering from similar stressors,\" she said. \"Understanding the causes of colony collapse is critical for identifying stressors that may affect all pollinators, and should help improve agriculture and beekeeping practices.\"Parasite problemAmong the stressors facing honeybees are gut parasites such as Nosema ceranae, which has become widespread globally.Infection of adult bees at a young age can cause them to have difficulty digesting food for the rest of their lives. Follow-on implications include a shorter lifespan and reduced colony health, population and performance, which can ultimately result in the colony dying.The antibiotic fumagillin has historically been deployed against Nosema species, but its use has been restricted in Europe as a result of bans on antibiotics in beekeeping and some studies have questioned how well it actually works in Nosema ceranae. That calls for new methods of prevention.\"We have to find natural solutions that do not create problems for bees and the environment,\" said Professor Diana Di Gioia, an agricultural microbiologist at the University of Bologna in Italy. \"The concept is that, if the host has an increased composition of beneficial bacteria, it can react better to parasites.\"She has led the NO PROBleMS project looking into potential new eco-friendly gut treatments for strengthening bees' resilience to disease. The initiative, which began in 2018, has been extended beyond a March 2023 end date.During the project, the team has conducted DNA-based studies involving both bacterial solutions and plant-derived products in the lab and in the field in Ireland, Italy, Malta and Argentina to study their effectiveness under varying climates and levels of infection.Secret formulaThe researchers have found that a formula containing a mixture of two types of beneficial microorganisms seemed to lead to a reduction in Nosema ceranae.The team has now developed a prototype formulation based on probiotic microorganisms and plant-derived molecules. The idea is that this formulation, for which a patent is being sought, can be fed to bees in their food and help improve their balance of microbiota.The hope is to run a follow-up project in which the formulation can be tested under different conditions and doses to hone it and pinpoint the best application methods.Apart from the benefits to bees, research into them may be very useful for examining the gut microbiome and its evolution more widely.\"With honeybees, we have this powerful tool,\" Di Gioia said. \"It looks as though the bee was made to be a model for examining the gut microbiota.\" More information: HarmHoney  NO PROBleMS Provided byHorizon: The EU Research & Innovation MagazineCitation:Facing external threats, bees may get help from internal organisms (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-external-threats-bees-internal.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the largest known living fish?",
    "text": "A trio of marine biologists from The University of Western Australia has found that some whale sharks will slow their swimming to allow researchers to scrape collections of copepods from sensitive areas. In their study, reported in the journal Fishes, Brendon Osorio, Grzegorz Skrzypek and Mark Meekan noticed that in recent years, whale sharks have become more cooperative as researchers attempt to collect parasite samples.          Marine scientists have been collecting skin and/or parasite samples from whale sharks for many years. The sharks represent the largest known living fish and the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate. They are sharks, not whales, and got their name due to their large size\u2014the largest confirmed size is 18.8 meters in length. The sharks are filter feeders and thus pose little risk of biting. Their large size, however, poses a risk of injury to other creatures that venture too close. Scientists study them to learn more about them and the environment in which they live\u2014the open sea.The researchers have been studying the sharks for nearly a decade, collecting samples of skin and tissue samples to learn more about what the sharks might be eating and how deep they dive. In more recent years, they found they could get roughly the same data by collecting copepods (a type of small parasitic crustacean) that adhere to the skin of the sharks. They also noted that suckerfish, which cling to the sharks, do so as a means to eat the copepods\u2014but tend only to clear copepods on flat, easy-to-reach parts of the skin. The copepods clinging to areas around the mouth and fins are left intact. For that reason, the researchers began targeting those areas using a small plastic knife to remove and bag the parasites.As time passed, the researchers gathered samples from the same shark more than once, and the sharks seemed to remember the encounters fondly\u2014they began slowing their swimming rate when the researchers approached, and in some cases, stopped swimming altogether, making it easier for the researchers to do their work.

    "question_squad": " What is the most prominent trait in sharks?",
    "text": "An international research team led by Faviel A. L\u00f3pez-Romero from the Department of Paleontology at the University of Vienna investigated how the jaw shape of sharks has changed over the course of evolution. They conclude that in the most widespread shark species, the jaws show relatively little variation in shape over millions of years; most variable jaws were found for deep-sea sharks. The results of this study were published in the journal Communications Biology.          One of the most prominent traits in sharks is the shape of their lower jaws, which bear also impressive teeth. With their jaws, sharks are able to feed on a wide variety of prey, which also places them among the Ocean's top predators. The wide prey spectrum is also reflected in the corresponding adaptations that sharks have evolved through out their evolutionary history. All of these adaptations allow them to spread into virtually all marine habitats, with some species even venturing into freshwater.How the shape of shark jaws changed during their evolution has now been investigated by an international and multidisciplinary research team, from the University of Vienna, Imperial College London (UK), Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle (Paris, France), Christian-Albrechts-University (Kiel, Germany), and Naturalis Museum (Leiden, The Netherlands). The results illustrate the importance of prey, level in the marine webs and habitat in relation to jaw shape diversity among shark species. This also helps to uncover the evolutionary causes of the differences in jaw morphology related to habitats.Today's sharks have a long evolutionary history with some taxa that can be traced as far as 180 million years ago. During all this time they have been a key component in the fauna of the marine realm and its food webs, mainly occupying higher trophic positions as meso and top predators. At the same time, sharks adopted many lifestyles and forms like bottom dwellers, fast swimmers in the open sea, and even some of the smallest species in the deep sea.To study the potential relationship between jaw morphology and the sharks' life style, a quantitative analysis was conducted using X-ray computed tomographic scans of the jaws of 90 shark species and preparing 3D reconstructions to estimate how jaw shape of sharks evolved through time.The results indicate surprisingly that among highly species-rich groups such as requiem sharks, the jaws display low shape variations. This is interesting since requiem sharks are one of the most widely distributed group of sharks. Another interesting finding is that most variable jaws were found among species living in the deep sea. \"Although sharks from the deep sea are not as extensively represented in the data as reef sharks, they display the most disparate forms seen in our analysis,\" explains first author L\u00f3pez-Romero.Among many adaptations, sharks inhabiting the deep sea exhibit, in addition to bioluminescence various feeding strategies that range from taking big chunks out of whales to feeding on eggs or on cephalopods. For most of the species found in reefs and the large top predators in the open sea, the options seem more limited so that most mainly prey on fishes, and even other shark species.\"Of course, many sharks in these environments feed on a large variety of prey with only few having adapted to a single, specific prey, such as the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, which preys almost entirely on hard-shelled crabs, while shrimps and fish are only capture occasionally,\" J\u00fcrgen Kriwet from the University of Vienna states, who was involved in this study.By studying the evolution of the jaw shape, it also was possible to reconstruct the evolutionary changes in jaw shape through deep time. \"Remarkable changes occurred in carpet, sleeper, and dogfish sharks. These changes were probably concomitant with the clear distribution of these sharks in reefs and the deep sea, which noticeably distinguishes them morphologically from other species with larger jaws as seen in the top predators in the open sea,\" concludes L\u00f3pez-Romero.

    "text": "Fisheries Research & Development Corporation (FRDC) has today released an independently reviewed report (2017-215) presenting a modeling and information system for water quality conditions in Tasmania's Storm Bay.          The research undertaken by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, has developed a new coastal water quality model, to assist informed decision-making based on accurate and timely information.The model presented in the Storm Bay Modeling and Information System report, simulates the seawater circulation and nutrient dynamics of the Storm Bay area, including inputs from rivers, wastewater and salmon farm discharge and interactions with offshore ocean water.The modeling system was developed using a \"digital twin\" approach; i.e., a virtual model of a physical object or in this instance, the coastal waters off southeast Tasmania. The model predicts the observed circulation and water quality in coastal waters over multiple years and can be used to explore future scenarios with various levels of salmon farming.FRDC Managing Director Dr. Patrick Hone said the model provides a high-quality scientific tool to help better understand what might happen in Storm Bay under different conditions in the future.\"This model provides information for the best practice management of Atlantic salmon farming in this area, and it also delivers detailed insight into potential changes to the coastal ecosystem in the future.\"As the Tasmanian salmon sector continues to innovate and develop, tools such as this provide invaluable insight into what we might expect under different conditions and allow us to understand the possible effects of potential changes to farming loads in the future,\" said Dr. Hone.Calibrated using observations from a previous project, this new model can accurately simulate local currents and water circulation, nutrient cycling, plankton and dissolved oxygen. To confirm the accuracy of the model, new continuous data were collected from moored water quality sensors placed on the bottom and surface of Storm Bay waters for extended periods. Profiling autonomous underwater vehicles, were also used to collect water quality observations throughout Storm Bay and in the open ocean, including one trip from Macquarie Harbor on the west coast of Tasmania.Simulated circulation, water quality and analysis products from the new model are available on the CSIRO website. This data and analysis provides a much-improved understanding of the whole marine environment within Storm Bay. The project final report is available on the FRDC website.Lead researcher from CSIRO Dr. Karen Wild-Allen, said the project provided new understanding of the key drivers of water quality in Storm Bay.\"The Storm Bay model has shown that water quality in the area is strongly influenced by inflow of offshore ocean water that contributes considerable seasonal and interannual variability to the system.\"\"A better understanding of all drivers of water quality will equip fish farmers and resource managers with knowledge to underpin their strategic and tactical decisions.\" Provided byCSIROCitation:A new model to monitor Atlantic salmon farming in Tasmania's Storm Bay (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-atlantic-salmon-farming-tasmania-storm.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "Chile's Patagonia is known for its mountains and hiking paradise but it is also home to the largest continuous kelp forest in the world.          Kelp forests are crucial for battling climate change by capturing carbon, regulating the sea's PH level, maintaining the structure of coasts and are home to multiple species.But more than half of the world's kelp forests have been decimated by human activity and climate change.\"We want to show that this is what can be lost if we don't protect them,\" said Max Bello, a Chilean expert on ocean policy who was part of a nine-day scientific expedition run by American NGO Mission Blue to study the kelp forest in the southern area of Chiloe, around 1,400 kilometers south of Santiago.\"When you say Patagonia, we imagine mountains, huge rocks, wind, but few people know what there is underwater,\" added Bello.\"We know that Patagonia has the largest and best preserved continuous kelp forest in the world.\"Bello said this potentially gave the kelp forest \"greater carbon sequestration power even than the Amazon rainforest.\"But it needs protecting\u2014a kelp forest off the coast of California has lost 97 percent of its size.                Kelp forests can store huge amounts of carbon, making them crucial in the fight against climate change.             One threat the southern Patagonian kelp forest faces is exploitation of alginate, a principal component in cosmetics which is extracted from algae, usually illegally along the northern coasts of Chile.\"If we don't protect ourselves from this threat, if we don't stop what is happening in the north, we will lose one of the few answers we have to be able to stop climate change,\" said Bello.A dozen scientists, videographers and photographers took part in the mission to Patagonia.They dived down up to 30 meters to collect information on this little explored ecosystem that expands across hundreds of islets, fjords and canals.\"They are truly playgrounds of many species\" such as mackerel, sardines, otters, mollusks, sea urchins and octopi, said Bello.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Patagonia's underwater defense against climate change (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-patagonia-underwater-defense-climate.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "The stable isotopes hydrogen and oxygen (\u03b42H and \u03b418O, respectively) in soil water are widely used in ecological studies, which rely on the accurate extraction of unfractionated water from different soil types. Cryogenic vacuum distillation (CVD) is the laboratory-based technique most widely used in eco-hydrological studies. However, the reliability of this technique in reflecting soil water \u03b42H and \u03b418O is still of concern.          In a study published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their collaborators assessed the reliability of CVD techniques for soil water extraction, and evaluated the potential influences of cryogenic extraction on plant water source partitioning. They investigated an automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation (ACVD) and two traditional extraction (TCVD) systems.The researchers oven-dried 225 soil samples containing different proportions of clay particles, doped them with deionized water and cryogenically extracted them using ACVD and TCVD systems. They then performed a sensitivity analysis of plant water uptake under four types of input data at seven sites.Compared with the TCVD, the newly developed ACVD technique could have similar or better performance. However, the two CVD techniques did not achieve unfractionated soil water \u03b42H and \u03b418O in the laboratory. Meanwhile, the isotopic offsets of the CVD techniques were correlated with soil clay content and soil water content of the extracted soil materials.\"The wide use of CVD techniques probably introduced noticeable uncertainties in the prediction of plant water uptake depths,\" said Dr. Song Liang of XTBG.Sensitivity analysis showed that the use of soil data corrected by CVD offsets improved the prediction performance of plant water uptake. The isotopic offsets of the CVD systems were positively correlated with soil clay content, and negatively correlated with soil water content.\"Our results will have important implications for further studies, which can provide a new solution to promote the prediction of plant water sources,\" said Song Liang.

    "text": "The deadly hospital pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii can live for a year on a hospital wall without food and water. Then, when it infects a vulnerable patient, it resists antibiotics as well as the body's built-in infection-fighting response. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as one of the three top pathogens in critical need of new antibiotic therapies.          Now, an international team, led by Macquarie University researchers Dr. Ram Maharjan and Associate Professor Amy Cain, have discovered how the superbug can survive harsh environments and then rebound, causing deadly infections. They have found a single protein that acts as a master regulator. When the protein is damaged, the bug loses its superpowers allowing it to be controlled, in a lab setting. The research is published in Nucleic Acids Research.\"We hope that our paper will encourage researchers worldwide to refocus on developing drugs to fight this superbug, which is spreading through the world's hospitals, and killing already vulnerable people in intensive care units and other high-risk areas,\" says Associate Professor Cain, the senior author on the paper.There are six superbugs that scare global health officials. E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria have common pathways that give them antibiotic resistance. A. baumannii is different. It's particularly tough, and it's one of the most resistant pathogens we encounter. Strangely, we don't know much about how it infects us.Breakthrough in a research challenge\"In the lab we can see this pathogen is very tough. Other researchers have shown that you can desiccate the bug for a year and when they added water, it was still able to infect mice,\" says Associate Professor Cain.\"The problem had been that A. baumannii is relatively new on the scene, emerging as a problem in hospitals in the 1980s. And it's hard to genetically manipulate with the existing molecular biology toolkit. It usually only infects sick people, but it is very resistant to antibiotics making it incredibly hard to treat and difficult to safely research. So, we don't know much about it. We don't know where it came from, nor how it became so resistant and resilient. Now, thanks to this paper, we know how it deals with stress.\"Amy and her colleagues realized about five years ago that they could make a difference by trying to understand the underlying biology of A. baumannii. That led to a major investment by Macquarie University in the research, in biocontainment laboratories for staff safety, and in an ethical animal model using moth caterpillars. The research effort has been strongly supported by the Australian Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.During infection our cells fight back by either flooding or starving bacteria of essential metals such as copper and zinc. A. baumannii has strong drug pumps that push antibiotics, metals and other threats out of the cell.\"By studying how this bug deals with infection stresses, we've found an important uncharacterized regulatory protein (DksA). When we disrupt this protein, it leads to changes in about 20 percent of the bug's genome and breaks its pumping system,\" says Dr. Ram Maharjan, a Macquarie University researcher and first author on the paper.Not only does this protein control stress response, but it also controls virulence. A. baumannii usually spreads in blood but our disruption also caused it to be completely undetected in the blood of both Galleria mellonella and mice. It also becomes super sticky and harmlessly sticks to organs.

    "question_squad": " What is the term for when a weed's genetic code mutates?",
    "text": "Eight years ago, University of Illinois and USDA-ARS scientists turned weed control on its head. More and more herbicide resistant weeds were popping up, and the pest plants were getting harder to kill. It was clear farmers could no longer rely on the same chemicals year after year. Industry campaigns and herbicide applicators began touting the benefits of rotating herbicides annually to avoid developing resistance, and rotation quickly became common practice.          But in 2015, a team of weed scientists from U of I and USDA-ARS studied the effects of herbicide rotation and found the practice actually increased resistance to glyphosate in waterhemp, a common and destructive Corn Belt weed. What worked, instead, was mixing multiple herbicides in the same tank and spraying simultaneously. Their large experiment, including 105 grain fields across Illinois, showed tank-mixing was 83 times less likely to lead to glyphosate resistance.The study had a powerful impact, with recommendations changing nearly overnight; tank-mixing herbicides is now de rigueur. But one of the study's authors is now urging farmers and industry players to remember tank-mixing only delays the evolution of resistance.\"I worry this practice has become overused. It's too simplistic to think all you need to solve the challenges of resistance is to go on using herbicides but in a slightly different way,\" said Aaron Hager, weed scientist and faculty Extension specialist in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences (ACES) at Illinois. Hager wrote about the topic in a new farmdoc article.He notes waterhemp is now resistant to herbicides from at least seven herbicide modes of action, despite the advantages of tank-mixtures. And some waterhemp populations are resistant to herbicides to which they have never been exposed. In other words, herbicide resistance is a complex and fast-moving target. And we're not keeping up.Speaking of targets, Hager notes the 2015 study focused on one type of herbicide evasion strategy: target-site resistance. That's when the weed's genetic code mutates such that the chemical no longer fits in the protein receptor\u2014target site\u2014it's designed to attack.More often nowadays, including in the case of waterhemp developing resistance to a chemical it had never before seen, weeds are using another strategy. It's known as metabolic or non-target site resistance. Here, weeds ramp up production of detoxifying enzymes that render herbicides useless before they can kill the plant.\"As far as we know, there are no data testing the hypothesis that herbicide mixtures are the most effective way to avoid the evolution of non-target site-based resistance mechanisms,\" Hager said. \"Without those data, how do we know which herbicides or what combinations remain effective against any waterhemp population? There is no simple way to know.\"Hager emphasizes that the problem of resistance to herbicides is the direct result of over-reliance on a single, simple solution: chemical weed control. The problem, in his view, won't be solved by exclusively using the same tools, but in different ways. Instead, he says farmers should diversify tactics and focus on preventing or eliminating weed seed production.\"Look, herbicides will continue to be valuable tools to help prevent crop yield loss, but we also must consider additional tactics to ensure no waterhemp plant is allowed to produce seed during the growing season. All we know with certainty is that if plants can't produce seed, the frequency of any resistance mechanism can't change or grow. Even a few seed-bearing waterhemp plants remaining in the field at harvest could contain the newest herbicide-resistance mechanism,\" Hager said. \"It's worth repeating: consider additional tactics to ensure no weed seed production.\" More information:farmdoc.illinois.edu/field-cro \u2026 as-some-believe.htmlProvided byUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignCitation:Tank-mixing herbicides may not be enough to avoid herbicide resistance (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-tank-mixing-herbicides-herbicide-resistance.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the main type of obstacles that machines must be able to handle?",
    "text": "From self-driving tractors to weeding robots and AI-powered data collection, automated machinery is revolutionizing agricultural production. While these technological advancements can greatly improve productivity, they also raise new questions about safety measures and regulations. To address these issues, a recent study from the University of Illinois reviewed current academic literature on the safety of automated agricultural machines. Based on a review of more than 60 papers, the researchers identified three main topics: environmental perception, risk assessment and mitigation, and human factors and ergonomics.          \"The majority of the research focuses on the first category, environmental perception. These studies primarily deal with how machines sense obstacles in the environment and respond to them. There is limited work on risk assessment or ergonomics,\" said Salah Issa, Illinois Extension specialist and assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at the U of I. Issa is corresponding author on the paper.Automated machines detect objects through perception sensors, which are then interpreted through machine learning algorithms to direct the equipment to stop, slow down, or change direction. There are three main types of obstacles that machines must be able to handle: positive, negative, and moving. Positive obstacles are objects that appear above ground, such as rocks, trees, and buildings. Negative obstacles are those that are lower than ground level, such as ditches and holes. Moving or dynamic obstacles are those that appear suddenly, such as a human being, an animal, or other moving machinery. These obstacles can vary widely, depending on type of crop, features of the area, and weather conditions.Issa and co-author Guy Roger Aby, doctoral student in ABE, found the research papers explored a wide variety of different receptor and sensor types, including 3D laser scanners, ultrasonic sensors, remote sensing, stereo vision, thermal cameras, high-resolution cameras, and more. Each type has advantages and limitations, and the most effective approaches include a combination of different methods.\"The trend in literature is towards utilizing multiple types of sensors, as opposed to just a single sensor. This is also the direction most companies are taking. It makes perfect sense for agricultural machines, given the very dynamic environments they operate in,\" Issa noted.\"However, there are still many questions that need to be addressed. For example, sensors must be sensitive enough to stop immediately if a human or other object appears. But if the machine stops and the farmer is not present, would they need to go back to check on the sensor and reset the machine? This is particularly challenging when it comes to quickly moving obstacles, like a passing squirrel or bird.\"      Automatic agricultural vehicles face some of the same challenges as self-driving cars, but there are also notable differences. For instance, agriculture presents a more complex environment than city driving, where roads are structured and marked. However, erratic human behavior in other drivers is a concern on city roads, but is less of a factor in agricultural fields, Issa notes.Only a few research papers addressed the second topic, risk assessment techniques and strategies. Issa says this is not surprising because most systems used in engineering for risk evaluation rely on historical data. That does not yet exist for autonomous systems in agriculture; there is little publicly available data about how they work and what the inherent risks are.\"We believe that existing safety standards are not well-suited for autonomous systems. But there's a significant effort underway to revise the current standards, so in a few years there will be new and revised standards,\" he said. Safety regulations addressing injuries and fatalities fall under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) but some states, including California and Indiana, also have their own regulations.The researchers identified a limited number of papers on the third topic, human factors and ergonomics.\"This is a particularly challenging issue in agriculture. In most manufacturing industries, human-robot interaction can be minimized. But some agricultural robots, such as harvesters and pickers, are designed to work in the same space as humans. The few papers on this topic explored human-robot interactions from an ergonomic perspective, focusing on how to improve machine design to ensure safety,\" Issa said.While autonomic robots are an emerging technology, some machines are already commercially available. For example, one company manufactures automatic sprayers for orchards, and self-driving tractors are being tested and implemented in select areas. Automated agricultural machines will undoubtedly become indispensable parts of modern farming in the next few decades, and robust safety systems are crucial for their widespread adoption, Issa and Aby concluded.The research is published in the journal Safety.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the endangered rabbit species?",
    "text": "With record-breaking storms wreaking havoc throughout California, even rabbits need rescuing.          For months, a team from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has navigated the Central Valley looking to rescue from rising floodwaters stranded riparian brush rabbits, a small, brown and white creature listed as an endangered species.Using canoes and motorboats, the five team members have trekked out in rivers from sunrise to past sundown in the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge to rescue rabbits. Some are stranded on high ground, on bush branches or trees. They are then taken to higher ground as the river water level floods the region.During operations in January and March, 286 rabbits have been rescued, said Fumika Takahashi, wildlife biologist at the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which includes the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge.More operations are planned for next week.\"These rabbits are resilient, they bounce back, but each one you rescue becomes important,\" she said.The rescue effort comes couple of months after the state endured one of the wettest winters in years.According to Fish and Wildlife Service, the riparian rabbit was believed to be found only in Caswell Memorial State Park and near Lathrop. But with dangerously low numbers, the species was reintroduced into the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge, about 75 miles northeast of San Jose.\"Riparian brush rabbits are especially vulnerable to floods because they live at the edges of rivers,\" refuge manager Eric Hopson said in a statement. \"They only live in a small area and there aren't many of them, so events like this can have a big impact on their population and recovery.\"Living near rivers, the animals have evolved to be able to survive floods, Takahashi said, but not for extended periods of time as they've had to do so this year.\"They're actually really good at climbing on vegetation and can even swim short distances,\" she said. \"But when we have these large floods, there's very little high ground for them to escape to.\"      Animals in the area have seen the San Joaquin River flood in the past, most recently in 2017. But climate change and the current landscape, with growing farms in the area, have meant the rabbit can no longer flee upland. Levees around the river have cut off the escape path for rabbits, and the flooding has directly affected their habitat.Because of this, officials created what are known as \"bunny mounds,\" or areas of high land in flood-prone areas where the animals can escape to during flood events. But these areas are also limited in food and can sometimes leave the rabbits exposed to predators.In January, 37 of the rabbits were rescued from the mounds. In March, 110 were found in the mounds.The rescues this year have been especially significant for the endangered rabbits, considering the refuge estimates there are only 2,000 to 3,000 rabbits in the area, said Takahashi.Biologists have worked to trap the rabbits and move them closer to drier land, at least four to five feet higher than the flood area.But they have had to be careful that their rescue efforts don't exacerbate a growing problem among the population. Since May 2022, veterinarians confirmed the riparian brush rabbits have been facing rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2, a highly contagious and deadly disease that has spread quickly in the western United States.To curb its spread, officials have vaccinated all of the rescued rabbits. But officials are also concerned that having more rabbits in a smaller area could advance the spread of the disease.Changing the ecosystem of the environment, moving the rabbits and increasing the concentration of their population could also mean other problems that haven't yet been spotted, said Erin Hagen, director of restoration science for River Partners, a nonprofit group that has worked with the refuge on the rescues.Officials are also concerned that climate change will leave the area more prone to flooding.\"Although they're in a safe elevation, we're not sure it's threaded the needle on being on the other side and being completely safe,\" Hagen said.    2023 Los Angeles Times.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "text": "Just in time for Mother's Day, rangers at Cape Hatteras National Seashore found the first sea turtle nest of the season Friday morning on Ocracoke Island.          \"While most of us were sleeping, this mom was working. Who can relate?!\" the National Park Service said in a Facebook post.Park biologists on routine patrol spotted mama's tracks from the ocean and back, leading them to a loggerhead nest.\"After following the tracks and carefully digging in the sand, a nest with eggs was confirmed,\" the post said.Biologists then covered the nest back up and installed rope fencing to protect it.\"Please adhere to signage and nighttime driving restrictions along the seashore as we share the beach with wildlife and provide them a safe nesting space,\" the park service said.Outer Banks sea turtle nesting season runs from May through September, with turtles returning year after year to lay their eggs by digging nests into the sand. About two months later, the tiny turtles hatch out, scatter across the beach and head to the ocean.Five species of turtles are found along the Outer Banks, the most common the loggerhead and green turtle. Leatherbacks, hawksbill and Kemp's ridleys also make appearances.This year's first Outer Banks nest arrived slightly earlier than usual.By following a few guidelines, people can help protect endangered sea turtles as they nest this summer. Here are some tips from the North Carolina Wildlife Commission:Because sea turtles nest mostly at night, beachfront property owners and those renting beachfront property are encouraged to turn off their outdoor lights and close their blinds/draperies after dark. Or, in lieu of turning off the lights, they can redirect lights so they are not visible on the beach.People on the beach after dark should refrain from using flashlights or cellphones. Bright, artificial light can deter females from coming on to shore to nest and can disorient sea turtle hatchlings, causing them to wander inland, where they often die of dehydration or predation.Beachgoers should remove beach equipment, such as lounge chairs, umbrellas, tents and other items from the beach when they leave. If left on the beach these items can prevent nesting attempts and prevent hatchlings from reaching the ocean. In fact, in many coastal towns, it is illegal to keep these items on the beach after dark.  2023 The Virginian-Pilot.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "text": "Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) is emerging as a powerful technique to provide detailed 3D images of cellular environments and enclosed biomolecules. However, one of the challenges of the methodology is the identification of protein molecules in the images for further processing.          A research team around Stefan Raunser, Director at the MPI of Molecular Physiology in Dortmund, led by Thorsten Wagner, developed software to pick proteins in crowded cellular volumes. The new open-source tool, called TomoTwin, is based on deep metric learning and allows scientists to locate several proteins with high accuracy and throughput without manually creating or retraining the network each time.The paper is published in the journal Nature Methods.\"TomoTwin paves the way for automated identification and localization of proteins directly in their cellular environment, expanding the potential of cryo-ET,\" says Gavin Rice, co-first author of the publication. Cryo-ET has the potential to decipher how biomolecules work within a cell and, by that, to unveil the basis of life and the origin of diseases.In a cryo-ET experiment, scientists use a transmission electron microscope to obtain 3D images, called tomograms, of the cellular volume containing complex biomolecules. To gain a more detailed image of each different protein, they average as many copies of them as possible\u2014similar to photographers capturing the same photo at varying exposures to later combine them in a perfectly exposed image. Crucially, one has to correctly identify and locate the different proteins in the picture before averaging them. \"Scientists can attain hundreds of tomograms per day, but we lacked tools to fully identify the molecules within them,\" says Rice.So far, researchers have used algorithms based on templates of already known molecular structures to search for matches in the tomograms, but these tend to be error-prone. Identifying molecules by hand is another option which ensures high-quality picking but takes days to weeks per dataset.Another possibility would be to use a form of supervised machine learning. These tools can be very accurate but currently lack usability, as they require manually labeling thousands of examples to train the software for each new protein, an almost impossible task for small biological molecules in a crowded cellular environment.TomoTwinThe newly developed software TomoTwin overcomes many of these obstacles: It learns to pick the molecules that are similar in shape within a tomogram and maps them to a geometric space\u2014the system is rewarded for placing similar proteins near each other and penalized otherwise. In the new map researchers can isolate and accurately identify the different proteins and use this to locate them inside the cell.\"One advantage of TomoTwin is that we provide a pre-trained picking model,\" says Rice. By removing the training step, the software can even run on local computers\u2014where processing a tomogram usually requires 60-90 minutes, runtime on the MPI supercomputer Raven is reduced to 15 minutes per tomogram.TomoTwin allows researchers to pick dozens of tomograms in the time it takes to manually pick a single one, therefore increasing the throughput of data and the averaging rate to obtain a better image. The software can currently locate globular proteins or protein complexes larger than 150 kilodaltons in cells; in the future, the Raunser group aims to include membrane proteins, filamentous proteins, and proteins of smaller sizes.

    "text": "A research article titled \"Aircraft Surveys for Air eDNA: Probing Biodiversity in the Sky\" unveils a revolutionary approach to studying genetic material in the atmosphere. Scientists have developed a durable and sterilizable probe and supporting system to capture air environmental nucleic acids (eDNA) with full-flow filtration and a high-integrity chamber.          Using this innovative probe, the research team aerially mapped environmental DNA by employing a standardized and scalable flight pattern using light aircraft. The aim of the study was to collect bioaerosols, which are aerosolized biological matter, from a range of organisms at various altitudes above major emissions sources, and sequence them for identification.This work began with an idea to explore, recounts Dr. Kimberly Metris, a faculty member at Clemson University and lead investigator. \"I'm a molecular ecologist who works on diverse wild species, from bacteria to bluehead chub to African buffalo. I also fly airplanes, and one summer while I was flying skydivers I had a lot of time to think while climbing to jump run altitude.\"\"Meteorologically speaking, the conditions were great\u201410 statute miles visibility, rather calm winds, a rather nice day at the office\u2014but this was during a Saharan dust storm and there was particulate matter visible outside, everywhere. An odd feeling, but it gets the wheels spinning.\"What precisely is in the air that we can't see, biologically speaking? This is what she and her co-author set out to explore. \"And now we are pushing the boundaries of what we thought we knew about the sky. The sky is not a limit, it is a treasure trove.\"The findings of the study are extraordinary. Through the use of their sampling probe and high throughput metagenomic sequencing, the researchers discovered the widespread presence of prokaryotic and eukaryotic eDNA in the atmosphere, reaching thousands of meters into the planetary boundary layer in the southeastern US. Notably, the study detected chicken, cow, and human eDNA at all altitudes flown, including an astonishing 8,500 feet above the ground.The researchers identified various common plant-based allergens from grasses, weeds, and trees, as well as from species not typically reported in the air, such as garlic, revealing a diverse array of airborne genetic material.They also discovered pathogenic bacteria and bacteria previously unknown to be present in the atmosphere but found in other extreme environments such as deep-sea sediment.      The sterilizable and reusable sampling probe employed in the study proved to be reliable, limiting sample loss and contamination while filtering genetic material directly from the air. This groundbreaking work enables the mapping of genetic material from potentially all species using aircraft or other flight or stationary methods and connects aerobiome profiles to ground level processes, providing valuable insight into the presence and diversity of genetic material found in the air we breathe.The implications of this research are far-reaching, with applications in biodiversity, wildlife ecology, biodefense, and pathogen and allergen monitoring. The study's high-throughput amplicon sequencing of DNA from bacteria, vertebrates, and plants demonstrates that bioaerosols can originate from natural processes, such as wind-induced pollination in fields and forests, and human-mediated activities, namely production agriculture, wastewater treatment, and industry practices including hospital waste decontamination.Airborne DNA profiles detected in the atmosphere reflect surface emissions, allergens, and potential ice and cloud condensation nuclei. The effectiveness of aerosolization is believed to influence the air DNA profiles detected at altitude, suggesting the incorporation of indices of lift and air mass characteristics for standardizing air eDNA surveys. Additionally, the researchers recommend standardized reporting of real-time, empirical flow rates, total air volumes, and sampler type(s) used, as they have crucially different operating airflow requirements.Biological material in the form of eDNA/RNA can be lifted, carried, and deposited elsewhere by atmospheric mixing, lifting, and buoyancy, potentially leading to biological consequences such as gene flow and hybridization processes.The atmosphere is powerful and essential to life\u2014The discovery of airborne vertebrate-derived eDNA floating thousands of meters from its origin at Earth's surface suggests that the atmosphere contains biodiverse material, and has implications for biomonitoring and disease surveillance. Scientists can gain insight into the presence, abundance, and distribution of species in an area, providing valuable evidence for identifying individuals or tracing their movements, or monitoring production agriculture from the atmosphere.This study paves the way for a deeper understanding of airborne genetic material and its implications for various fields of study. By unlocking the secrets of the sky, scientists are gaining new insights into our environment, the air we breathe, and intricate connections among biodiversity on Earth. More information:Kimberly L.

    "question_squad": " What did Gabor Lovei do to see how the ecosystem reacted to the changes?",
    "text": "Humans first started farming about 12,000 years ago. On the shores of the Euphrates and the Tigris, in what is now Iraq and Syria, small groups of people started to grow peas, lentils and barley independently of each other. They felled trees to make space for fields and animals, and in so doing began to shape nature according to the needs of humans.          Back then, our ancestors already knew that, after the forest was felled and the fields were established, some of the animals and plants that had previously thrived would disappear. Today, we know that modern, intensive agriculture is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity on the planet.However, we actually know very little about what specifically happens to plants, insects and animals in the ecosystem when a forest is felled and the soil is plowed and planted.Therefore, Gabor Lovei from the Department of Agroecology at Aarhus University and a number of Portuguese colleagues decided to investigate. On the island of Terceira in the Azores, there is still a part of the original forest. For this reason, the island made a good place to study how agriculture affects original nature.However, when Gabor Lovei saw his results, he was a little surprised.\"The changes in the ecosystem were less extensive than I'd imagined. True enough, there were fewer large and small animals in the fields, but on a number of other parameters, activity in the ecosystem had actually increased,\" he says.The unique nature on the AzoresUntil 1427, very few people had set foot on the Azores. Recent archaeological findings suggest that the Vikings perhaps visited the islands many hundred years before the Portuguese, but it was not until the 15th century that humans settled there permanently.For thousands of years, the Azores were left untouched and lush in the middle of the Atlantic. Deep-green trees and plants thrived because of the islands' combination of high heat, frequent precipitation and volcanic soil.After Portuguese sailors accidentally discovered the forested mountains in the middle of the Atlantic in 1427, everything changed.Smallholders, who were tired of the royal favors poured on manor houses in Portugal, packed their picks, shovels and hoes and sailed out to the Azores. They felled the forest and planted wheat and other crops.Unlike at home on the mainland, the farmers reaped huge yields at harvest. Rumors spread and farmers poured to the islands. Large parts of the forest quickly disappeared and were replaced by agricultural land. Only the parts of the forest in the most mountainous and inaccessible areas, where the soil was too difficult to cultivate, were spared.And it was precisely this original forest that Gabor Lovei could use in his research.\"In Denmark\u2014and most other places in Europe\u2014the forest is not original. It has been felled, replanted and changed by humans for thousands of years. In the Azores, on the other hand, there is completely original forest\u2014and it's gold for this type of research,\" he says.      Gabor's clever trickNormally, when entomologists or ornithologists study how agriculture affects different species, they jump into their hiking boots and go out into fields, meadows and forest fringes to record everything they find. They do so systematically, at different times of the day and repeatedly.However, the method does not tell us as much about how the entire ecosystem reacts to changes. Only about the animal populations.So when Gabor Lovei set out to investigate how the entire ecosystem reacted to forest felling and field establishment, he had to use other methods.First, he planted a number of full-grown lettuces in an original forest, on cultivated fields, and on grazing fields for cows. The plants were left for two weeks. After the two weeks, he recorded the area covered by the lettuce, and how much had been eaten. In this way, he could measure the extent of the plant-eating activity in the ecosystem.He repeated the same process with larvae to determine the scope of the hunt for insects. The more larvae eaten, the more animals\u2014e.g. birds, rodents and frogs\u2014lived in the area. He also put out small boxes of seeds to see how many disappeared. He dug teabags ten centimeters into the soil to examine the activity of the microorganisms in the soil that break down organic matter.And finally, he planted strawberries to learn more about the pollination in the different areas.Together, all these small experiments formed a picture of how the ecosystem as a whole changes when forest is felled and fields are planted.                Heat, recurring rain and volcanic soil makes the nature on the Azores extremely fertile. In fact farmers can harvest year-round on the islands - and a great deal of the fruit we eat in Europa comes from the Azores. Many animals graze also pastures on the islands. This picture is from the island of Terceira, snapped close to some famous vulcanic tunnels. Credit: Jules Verne Times Two / Creative Commons             Fewer animals in the fieldsOf all the parameters Gabor Lovei studied, the greatest difference was in the number of insects eaten. In the forest, significantly more larvae disappeared than in the cultivated field and grazing areas.This suggests that there is more wildlife in the forest, he explains.\"Larvae are typically eaten by rodents, birds and lizards. Our findings suggest that there were significantly more of them in the forest, because more larvae disappeared between the trees,\" he says.The seeds also disappeared more quickly in the forest.\"The humidity is higher in the forests, and this means that several different invertebrates can live there. Animals like snails and beetles, which eat seeds.\"With regard to pollination and the number of microorganisms in the soil, he did not find any difference. In fact, plant pollination was slightly higher on the maize fields than in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that there are many different species of bee. There are usually only a few plant types on cultivated fields. For this reason, the same few bee species are responsible for pollination.What can farmers do?When local farmers fell forest, biodiversity is lost. Gabor Lovei has clearly demonstrated this in his experiments. But can his results also say something about what farmers can do to get some of the biodiversity back on their fields?Yes, he explains. They can. The results provide a completely new understanding of which parts in the ecosystem will be affected.\"We clearly see that snails and beetles have a hard time on the fields. To get them back, farmers can leave small pockets of natural vegetation in the fields. For example, they can leave roots from dead trees to rot. This will attract many kinds of beetles,\" he says.Another problem with the fields is that we humans bring with us animals, plants and microbes that do not belong there naturally when we grow our crops. For example, rats invaded and displaced a large part of the indigenous fauna on the Azores.\"By making space for small pockets of non-cultivated nature in and around the fields, we know that the native species will survive more easily. They're simply more resistant to invading species,\" he explains.Can the results be transferred to Denmark?Nature in the Azores is very different from Denmark. Denmark is colder, the soil is different, and we have virtually no original nature left.Nevertheless, the results from the Azores can be transferred to Danish conditions, according to Gabor Lovei.\"Such comprehensive experiments have never been conducted on the European mainland, but some of the parameters have been studied in other European countries. The pattern was roughly the same. Therefore, we can assume that Danish nature reacts more or less in the same way to deforestation and cultivation,\" he says.\"However, agriculture is not all that threatens biodiversity. Cities and gardens also restrict where animals can live. That's why it's important to do something in our own backyard,\" he concludes.Sowing flowers and trees that belong naturally in Denmark\u2014and not exotic plants\u2014can make a big difference. Plant Danish trees and Danish flowers and stop mowing the lawn. This will make a huge difference for many species.The study is published in the journal Basic and Applied Ecology.

    "question_squad": " What is the theoretical potential for additional wood harvest?",
    "text": "The energy crisis has shown Europe the need to become more self-sufficient in resources. Wood is one of those resources, used in the construction sector, for example, and is already largely produced in the EU itself. The demand for wood is still increasing. However, a new study shows that the additional potential for wood harvesting is limited, and smaller than previously thought, unless more investments are made in afforestation and forest management.          Wood is a renewable resource, has many different uses, and is an important means of CO2 storage. As such, it is not surprising that wood is increasingly in demand. But where should it come from? According to the study that was recently published in Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research, a small increase in wood harvest in European forests will be possible. An international team from 10 European model regions has done research on how behavioral change by forest managers can lead to a sustainable wood harvest increase.In addition, a literature review has been carried out into the ambitions of each European country with regard to wood harvesting. This has shown that an additional 90 million m3 of wood could be harvested annually from European forests in the next 10\u201320 years. When barriers are considered in detail, however, the potential turns out to be much smaller.At the same time, forests are under pressure as a result of climate change. If we want to produce more wood from European forests in the long term, we must invest in forest vitality and afforestation.The wood increment is much larger than the amount harvested\"Every year, much more wood grows in Europe than we harvest. The difference between increment and harvest is called the theoretical potential for additional wood harvest,\" says lead author Bas Lerink of Wageningen University & Research. This theoretical potential amounts to about 250 million m3 per year.Lerink says, \"But only a part of it will be realistic. There are several reasons why it is better not to harvest in some forests. To prevent soil erosion or to protect biodiversity, for example. As a result, this theoretical potential will never be achieved.\" In the study, Lerink and colleagues have combined two ways to determine a realistic potential.      Realistic increase in wood harvestThe literature review was conducted based on national forest strategies and other policy documents. Based on this, the researchers determined each country's ambition to increase their wood harvest in the near future (10\u201320 years) on a current total harvest of approximately 546 million m3. In total, this will lead to a realistic potential of 90 million m3 per year for the EU and the United Kingdom.In addition, the EFISCEN Space forest resource model was used to develop projections for future wood harvest in 10 model regions, based on forest inventory data. First, the model applied forest management regimes as currently carried out in the regions. Next, these were compared to a number of scenarios with more intensive management, derived from neighboring regions, for example.This has shown that the realistic potential for additional wood harvest is much smaller than the literature review suggested, namely half, about 40 million m3. National forest strategies seem to overestimate harvesting possibilities.The state of European forestsHow does an increase in wood harvest relate to the current state of European forests? There are indeed concerns about the health of European forests. Climate change has greatly increased natural disturbances (such as fires, diseases and pests) and CO2 sequestration is already declining in some countries. Still, since the Second World War, there has not been as much wood in European forests as there is now.A small increase in wood harvest (by the aforementioned 40 million m3 per year) still seems to be realistic. To give an idea of the scale, this is enough to build about 800,000 wooden houses in the EU per year.\"But in the long term, a larger wood harvest will only be feasible if forest restoration, afforestation and forest management improvements are already started now. These are important for Europe to become more self-sufficient,\" says co-author Gert-Jan Nabuurs. \"Education, cooperation between forest owners and forest industry and governments will be necessary. This will make the EU less dependent on other continents, and also contribute to sustainable forest management with enhanced biodiversity in a bio-economy.\" More information:Bas J W Lerink et al, How much wood can we expect from European forests in the near future?, Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research (2023).

    "text": "A new conservation tool in the field of coral reef ecology has been developed by University of Hawai'i (UH) at M\u0101noa researchers using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology. By developing novel deep learning algorithms, coral ecologists in the UH M\u0101noa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) are now able to identify and measure reef halos from space.          These features, also known as grazing halos or sand halos, consist of ring-like patterns of bare sand that occur around coral patch reefs, and their presence is readily visible from satellite images.\"Reef halos may be important indicators of the health and vitality of coral reefs, but until now, their measurement and tracking has been a challenging and time-consuming process,\" said Simone Franceschini, lead author of the study and postdoctoral research fellow in the Madin Lab at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in SOEST. \"However, with this new method, we can accurately identify and measure reef halos on a global scale in a tiny fraction of the time it would take a human being to accomplish the same task.\"\"We're aiming to develop a freely available remote sensing tool to monitor ecological processes over large scales to improve the understanding and management of coral reef ecosystems,\" said Elizabeth Madin, the study's senior author and associate research professor at HIMB. \"Our current research shows that reef halos may represent an emerging opportunity to monitor reef ecosystems' function at large scales, including in remote and otherwise inaccessible areas.\"In recent years, computer vision techniques have been increasingly used to recognize patterns in medical and biological studies. In ecology, applications of image analysis coupled with advancements in satellite imaging technology have improved large-scale ecosystem analysis and wildlife conservation.\"This work stems from our team's understanding of the current state of AI technology and its potential applications for conservation research in coral reef ecosystems,\" Madin added.                Halos in the Red Sea. Credit: CNES/Airbus; DigitalGlobe.             Although AI technology has shown excellent performance in the field of image analysis, the identification of halos\u2014a complex, ecological pattern with much variation\u2014was a challenge that required combining different deep learning algorithms.      \"Reef halos are sometimes very clear in satellite imagery, with distinct edges and high contrast with background vegetation, but sometimes they are quite faint and hard to distinguish\u2014even by a highly trained observer,\" said Franceschini.\"In the end, our team was able to develop a set of algorithms capable of taking into account the diversity of these patterns globally and identify and measure halos with surprising accuracy. It is hugely satisfying for us to now have built something that can accurately identify more than 90% of halos in some parts of the world.\"Coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, upon which many millions of people globally depend, are under threat from overfishing, climate change, and many other factors. These ecosystems, and particularly the impact of fisheries and marine reserves on them, are notoriously difficult to monitor at large scales and over time.\"This breakthrough is a key step in scaling up\u2014in both space and time\u2014our ability to monitor and quantify aspects of coral reef ecosystem health,\" said Madin. \"By providing a more efficient and effective way to measure coral patch reefs and their surrounding halos, this new method paves the way for the development of a global-scale reef conservation and monitoring tool based on the phenomenon of reef halos.\"The team is aiming to develop, in the near future, a freely-available web app that can allow conservation practitioners, scientists, and resource managers to remotely, quickly, and inexpensively monitor aspects of reef health using satellite or drone imagery.The study is published in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.

Scientific Reports has published the findings, which add to the understanding of the neurochemistry of social learning.          \"We found that the oxytocin system is involved from an early age in male zebra finches learning song,\" says Natalie Pilgeram, first author of the study and an Emory Ph.D. candidate in psychology. \"It's basic science that may lead to insights into the process of vocal learning across the animal kingdom, including humans.\"\"Our results suggest that the neurochemistry of early social bonds, particularly during language learning, may be relevant in studies of autism,\" adds Donna Maney, a professor of neuroscience in Emory's Department of Psychology and senior author of the study.Young male zebra finches learn to sing by listening to an adult male tutor to whom they choose to pay close attention; normally their biological father or a \"foster\" father who nurtures them. This social process holds some similarities for how children learn to speak, making the birds a laboratory model for the neural underpinnings of social vocal learning.In the current paper, the researchers show how oxytocin, a hormone essential to social bonding, influences young finches exposed only to the songs of unfamiliar males. In experiments, blocking the young birds' oxytocin receptors while they listened to a male biased the birds against that male's song. Instead they preferred to listen to and eventually learn the song of a male they heard when their oxytocin receptors were allowed to function normally.The paper builds on previous work by the Maney lab regarding the hormonal and genetic influences on social behavior. Her lab is working with researchers at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta to maximize any potential translational impact of its research findings.Finding their voiceZebra finches are highly social birds. In the wild they nest together in large colonies. Only adult males sing, primarily to court females.From the time they hatch, the males begin listening for song, and memorizing particular songs, even before they can actually sing one. \"Up until around day 50, they are making little cheeps and warbles, what we call 'subsong,'\" Pilgeram explains. \"It's similar to human infants who begin to babble at around six months without actually talking.\"During this sensitive listening phase, a male zebra finch pays closest attention to the song of its father, even though it can hear other adult males nearby.In a laboratory environment, research shows that if a biological father is removed from a cage before a male hatches and then replaced with a \"foster father\" with whom they can interact, the young male will prefer the song of the foster father over other males it can hear. The young males demonstrate this preference by pressing levers that allow them to hear playback of different songs.      Learning from their environment\"The young birds have got to learn all that they can from their environment,\" Pilgeram says. \"Just as during human development, the birds pay the closest attention to their immediate caregivers, on whom they rely for everything.\"Around day 50, the young male finches enter puberty and what is called the \"plastic song phase.\" During this time, they practice their song motor skills and actively try to produce song. Although they begin to shift their attention away from their fathers and show a preference for hearing songs of other males, each young male still practices dad's tune.By day 100, most male zebra finches are fully singing their father's song. They have reached adulthood and their tune has \"crystalized\" into the song that they will sing for the rest of their lives.In previous research, the Maney lab found that the stronger the preference a male zebra finch shows for its father's song during the early listening phase, the more closely its crystalized adult song will mimic that of the father.The role of oxytocinFor the current paper, the researchers wanted to test whether the oxytocin system played a role in that preference.The research centered on male juvenile zebra finches hatched in the lab. At day four, the fathers were removed from each of the youngsters' cages so they were raised only by their mothers. The cages were enclosed in chambers that prevented the young birds from hearing song from other birds housed nearby.Beginning at day 27 in a young bird's life, it was exposed to a series of tutoring sessions by two different adult male tutors that it had never heard. The tutor's cage was placed next to the cage of the young bird, or pupil. When it was exposed to one of the tutors, the pupil was given a substance that blocked its oxytocin receptors from activating. When the young bird was exposed to the other tutor, it received a control substance that allowed its oxytocin receptors to function normally.After completing a series of tutoring sessions, the pupils were presented with two different levers they could press in their cages. Pressing one lever was more likely to play the song they heard when their oxytocin receptors were blocked. The other lever was more likely to play the song they heard with normally functioning oxytocin.The results showed that early in their development, the juveniles favored the song that they heard when their oxytocin was not blocked.Building on past findings\"We also found that when their oxytocin was not blocked, the birds' developmental milestones fit the same data curve as in our previous research,\" Maney says. \"They showed an early preference for the song of one tutor, then switched to preferring the other song during puberty.\"The preference flattened out as they began singing the song of their chosen tutor, she adds. And the stronger the preference that they showed for the chosen tutor's song during the early listening phase, the more closely their own adult song resembled that of the chosen tutor.The researchers also noted behavioral differences in the way the pupils and tutors interacted. With normally functioning oxytocin, a pupil pecked more often at the wall of its cage facing the tutor and more often preened in a fashion known to be associated with focused listening in the birds, compared to when its oxytocin was blocked.\"Our results suggest that the oxytocin system is involved in how an animal decides where to focus its attention very early in its life,\" Pilgeram says.Co-authors of the study include Carlos Rodr\u00edguez-Saltos, who received his doctorate from Emory and is now at Illinois State University; postdoctoral fellow Nicole Baran; research technicians Matthew Davis and Erik Iverson; and Emory undergraduates Sumin Lee, Emily Kim and Aditya Bhise.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the workflow that is used to compile fossil pollen data?",
    "text": "A new study published in Global Ecology and Biogeography presents a step-by-step guide to compile numerous fossil pollen datasets into a user-specific, standardized and clean compilation\u2014ready for further analysis.          Paleoecology is important for understanding the history of biodiversity and the biosphere changes over time. By using paleoecological data such as fossil pollen, scientists try to understand how ecosystems and vegetation changes through time, and how humans have affected the environment throughout history.In the last ten years, there has been a substantial increase in fossil pollen data from all over the world in open-access databases, opening new avenues for research. But there are some challenges to putting this information together in a way that scientists can use it to study biodiversity changes.Researcher at The Department of Biological Sciences, UiB, and leading first author of the paper \"A guide to the processing and standardization of global paleoecological data for large-scale syntheses using fossil pollen,\" Suzette Flantua, has been working on these datasets.\"For several years now we have been compiling thousands of fossil pollen datasets together, and we've realized along the way that many critical steps exist that any researcher using these data should be aware of, but there were no clear guidelines anywhere. It was also often unclear how other people processed their data,\" says Flantua.To ensure a standardized use of fossil pollen data and minimize the risk of erroneous interpretations, Flantua and her colleagues have created a guide with tips and tricks for compiling fossil pollen data.\"These datasets come from many different environments around the world, they are cored and analyzed by many different researchers, and they represent highly diverse plant assemblages. Before any analysis can be done, such compilation needs to be carefully selected to guarantee good data quality. That is why we have developed a guide on how to standardize these data that are now accessible for many researchers in different fields,\" says Flantua.Discipline-friendly guideline to process fossil pollen dataOnd\u0159ej Mottl, the leading developer of the software in the guide, and co-leading first author of the paper, says that the guide is designed to make data preparation easy and accessible for everyone, regardless of their coding skills.\"We understand that handling all data preparation steps can be technically challenging, which is why we've structured our workflow step-by-step and provided clear signposts at each critical juncture. Our software interacts with users throughout the process, guiding them towards the desired dataset for analysis,\" says Mottl.The fossil pollen dataset guide consists of a workflow called FOSSILPOL, an R-package (RFossilpol) and a website. The FOSSILPOL workflow handles most of the processing steps (related to depositional environments, chronologies, filtering and taxonomic harmonization), while requiring input from the user at certain steps.All criteria and configurations are defined in one main configuration file, and several R packages are used throughout the workflow. The final outputs of the workflow include a standardized compilation of taxonomically harmonized fossil pollen data, plots of modeled age-depth curves and a pollen diagram for each record, and several overview figures and maps.Co-leading first authors Vivian Felde and Kuber Bhatta highlight the guide's potential to increase reproducibility and transparency.\"It can also be seen as a tool that allows full reproducibility of major data analyses as all decisions throughout the data processing steps are transparent, well documented, and easily reported in studies. In addition, the data compilation is dynamic and will change together with the open access databases as increasingly more data becomes available. This is all thanks to constant data sharing within and between research communities, which we are really excited about,\" agree Felde and Bhatta. More information:Suzette G. A.

    "question_squad": " What is the most common grain used to make malt for beer?",
    "text": "When Fusarium head blight (FHB) threatens winter barley, the best time to apply a fungicide is about six days after full barley head emergence, according to a recent study published in Plant Disease.          FHB, also known as scab, is a fungal disease that attacks small grains, discoloring the heads and contaminating the grain with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), a toxic compound also known as vomitoxin. For barley, the most common grain used to make malt for beer and spirits, even a small amount of DON can cause crops to be rejected by purchasers. The disease in malted barley kernels may lead to gushing, or the rapid and uncontrolled foaming of beer, making the crop unusable for beer production.In a four-year study, researchers with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the University of Minnesota assessed three different fungicides for FHB reduction. The researchers evaluated the amount of DON present in mature winter barley heads following a fungicide application at one of three growth stages\u2014half heading, full heading, and six days after full barley head emergence.\"The latest timing of fungicide application reduced DON significantly more than the early timing for all three fungicides tested in the study,\"said Christina Cowger, small grains pathologist at ARS's Plant Science Research Unit in Raleigh, North Carolina. \"Applying fungicide before all heads were emerged did not significantly reduce DON in winter barley as compared to not spraying at all. If scab is threatening, growers should wait about six days after barley heads have all appeared before applying fungicide.\"According to Cowger, eastern U.S. barley growers have two main tools for FHB management\u2014plant moderately resistant varieties and apply a fungicide. By understanding the best timing for fungicide to minimize FHB, growers can manage high-FHB epidemic years and maximize profits from malting barley.FHB is one of the factors limiting the global production of barley since it can result in yield loss and economic damage. According to the American Phytopathological Society, the disease has cost U.S. wheat and barley farmers more than $3 billion since 1990.\"Year in and year out, FHB is the disease that most threatens profitable wheat and barley production in the U.S.,\" Cowger said. \"Knowing how to get the most out of our FHB management tools is key to small grain profitability.\" More information:Christina Cowger et al, Optimal timing of fungicide application to manage Fusarium head blight in winter barley, Plant Disease (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the organization that studies the effects of early life adversity on humans?",
    "text": "There's something most species\u2014from baboons to humans to horses\u2014have in common: When they suffer serious adversity early in life, they're more likely to experience hardship later on in life.          When researchers from the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and the University of Michigan decided to look at this question in gorillas, they weren't sure what they would find.Previous studies by the Fossey Fund revealed that young gorillas are surprisingly resilient to losing their mothers, in contrast to what has been found in many other species. But losing your mother is only one of many potential bad things that can happen to young animals.\"Assuming that you survive something that we consider early life adversity, it's often still the case that you will be less healthy or you will have fewer kids or your lifespan will be shorter\u2014no matter what species you are,\" said U-M anthropologist Stacy Rosenbaum, senior author on the study. \"There's this whole range of things that happens to you that seems to just make your life worse in adulthood.\"But instead, the researchers found that gorillas who survived past age six were largely unaffected by difficulties they encountered as infants or juveniles. The study is published in the journal Current Biology.Like other species, humans also deal with early life adversity, and the effects of this can follow us into adulthood, such as a shorter lifespan or health complications, Rosenbaum said. But in humans, it's difficult to tease out whether we, for example, develop cancer or die early as adults because of an adverse event early in life per se, or whether it's because of a multitude of behavioral, environmental and cultural factors\u2014or a combination of all of the above.Studying these early adverse events in nonhuman species could help researchers understand how such events affect humans, and how to mitigate them.\"When you look at animals, you remove a lot of the variation that we have in humans. For example, they are all eating similar diets, they all get exercise as part of their daily lives, they don't have the opportunity to engage in behaviors with negative health outcomes like smoking,\" said Robin Morrison, a researcher with the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and lead author on the study.      But despite this, in most species it is still the case that early adversity can have negative effects in adulthood, which suggests that there is some kind of deeper biological mechanism there that we don't understand very well, Morrison said. That gorillas show a different pattern suggests these early life adversities can be overcome. Understanding why and how this happens can have significant implications for our own species, she said.Like humans, gorillas live a long time and have a small number of offspring that they heavily invest in. This makes them a good comparative animal model for understanding the ramifications of early life adverse events. The researchers looked at 55 years of long-term data collected in 253 wild mountain gorillas, 135 of which were male and 118 female. These gorillas live in Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, and have been monitored for more than five decades by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.The researchers identified six different kinds of early life adversity: losing a father or mother, experiencing the death of a group member by infanticide, social group instability, having few age-mates in the social group, and having a competing sibling who was born soon after them. The data included information about how many of these early adversities each gorilla experienced and at what age, as well as how long each gorilla lived.The researchers looked at what happened when a gorilla experienced none, one, two or three or more adverse events. They found that the more of these adverse events gorillas experienced before age 6, the more likely they were to die as juveniles. But if, despite experiencing early adversity, they survived until age 6\u2014past their juvenile stage\u2014the researchers found no evidence that their lifespans were shorter, no matter how many adverse events the gorillas suffered.In fact, if a gorilla experienced three or more forms of adversity, it actually lived longer; this group of animals had a 70% reduction in the risk of death across adulthood. But this was driven by greater longevity in males specifically, and the researchers suspect the trend was due to something called viability selection. This means that if a gorilla was strong enough to survive difficult early life events, it might just be a \"higher-quality individual,\" and thus more likely to have a longer life span.\"I was expecting to see that these gorillas would have short lifespans and would not do very well as adults,\" Rosenbaum said. \"We found that these events are definitely associated with a much higher risk of death when you're young. But if you survive to age 6, there's no evidence that those shorten your lifespan at all. This is quite different from what we see in other species.\"The researchers have some theories about why these mountain gorillas were so resilient. Gorillas have very tight-knit social groups and prior studies have shown that when a young gorilla loses its mom, it doesn't actually become more isolated: other gorillas fill the gap in social companionship.\"The youngster actually increases its time near other gorillas after the loss of its mom and in particular the highest-ranking adult male, even if he isn't their biological father,\" Morrison said. \"These strong networks might provide critical social buffering, as has been shown in humans. The quality of our social relationships is a very important predictor of our health and longevity\u2014in some cases, more important than genetics or lifestyle.\"Another reason they may be relatively buffered from the consequences of adversity is that mountain gorillas live in a resource-rich environment compared to many other wild primates. It may be easier for a gorilla to survive difficult circumstances if they are not also constantly dealing with the stress of finding enough food and water, Rosenbaum said.\"For comparison, savanna baboons\u2014who were the inspiration for this analysis\u2014live in this highly seasonal environment where they go through extreme droughts. They sometimes will have to walk miles to get to a water hole. They're often struggling for every single calorie they take in,\" she said. \"That's not the world that mountain gorillas live in. They're often described as living in a giant salad bowl.\"The researchers' findings suggest that species similar to our own can have significant resilience to early life adversity. The results also raise important questions about the biological roots of sensitivity to early experiences, and the protective mechanisms that contribute to resilience in gorillas.\"I don't think we should assume that the long-term negative effects of early life adversity are universal,\" Rosenbaum said. \"We tend to talk about this as if it's a ubiquitous experience, and a given that your adulthood is going to be compromised if you live through early adversity.\"But I don't think it's nearly that cut-and-dry, even in the human literature. I think the data are a lot more complex for humans and this research would suggest that they might be more complex for other animals, too. And I actually think that that's a hopeful story.\" More information:Robin E.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the website that allows people to find out which birds once lived in their area?",
    "text": "Most of the declining species are farmland birds, where a mix of increasingly industrialized agriculture, habitat loss and the climate crisis are having severe impacts.          The dawn chorus is a lot quieter nowadays.While 50 years ago it might have been normal to hear the rhythmic call of a cuckoo or the gentle trill of a turtle dove, these sounds are becoming ever rarer.This is because a new study has found that over this time Britain has lost almost a third of all its wild birds. If these declines continue unabated, it is not inconceivable that future generations will grow up never having heard the call of a cuckoo or a song thrush.The staggering numbers are the result of research by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), who have looked back to data from the 1970s to try and get a better idea of how many wild birds lived in Britain at that time, before comparing the stats to more modern surveys.What they have revealed is a shocking decline of birds. Over the past five decades, Britain has lost close to 30 million house sparrows, 20 million starlings, four million skylarks, two million blackbirds and one million chaffinches.Professor Juliet Vickery, the BTO's Chief Executive, says, \"BTO's wealth of data means we can confidently report this alarming drop in the U.K.'s breeding bird population.\"                Nightingales have been hit hard, with populations declining by 90% over the past 50 years. Credit: Karel Zahradka/Shutterstock             \"In the last 50 years, my own area of Cambridgeshire farmland has experienced some of the highest declines of species in Britain and Ireland. I can no longer hope to hear nightingales singing or enjoy house martins quite literally sharing my home.\"\"Future generations may well not hear or see song thrushes, cuckoos or kestrels in the area either. We must all do more to reverse these relentless declines and we need to do it urgently.\"The BTO have now published their results on a website that allows anyone in the U.K. to discover which bird species once lived in your local area, and which ones are doing well, simply by entering your postcode.      Crashing numbersOne of the biggest drivers for the decline of British birds, and biodiversity in general, is thought to be changes in agricultural practices and land-use.This has resulted in farmland birds having suffered the worst declines over the past 50 years, which were at their worst in the late 1970s and 1980s. This was largely due to the rapid changes in farmland management during the 1950s and 1960s. But these declines have continued into recent decades.                Not all species are declining, with wood pigeons helping to bring up the total number of birds in Britain. Credit: Branislav Cerven/Shutterstock             Recent data released by the U.K. government, for example, has found that 48% of all bird species in the U.K. declined in just the five years between 2015 and 2020. While within this period woodland birds were found to be doing the worst, the government data also showed that, overall, it was the farmland birds that have declined the most.The BTO data underscores this, showing how there are now 73 million fewer birds in our skies. This number, however, is masked by an increase of some 41 million birds from certain species such as wrens, wood pigeons and blackcaps. The total estimated loss of individual birds is actually an even sharper drop of some 114 million.While these numbers are extremely concerning, we do at least know what is causing them. The destruction of habitats, be it hedgerows surrounding fields or flower rich meadows, the increase in the use of harmful pesticides and shift in agricultural practices that has resulted in a lower diversity of plants being grown, have all played a role.\"Presenting these results at the local level, so that anyone can see the changes that have happened on their doorstep simply by entering their postcode, delivers a powerful message that the U.K.'s birds are in trouble, and that we all need to do more,\" explains Juliet.The data from the BTO is vital to a get a better understanding of the true state of nature in the U.K. We now know what is impacting biodiversity in the U.K., and we know how to fix it.

    "text": "Wavy wounds heal faster than straight wounds because shapes influence cell movements, a team of researchers at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) study has found.          Using advanced imaging equipment on synthetic wounds that mimic the human skin, the NTU Singapore scientists observed the motion of cells and found that those near wavy shaped wounds moved in a swirling manner while cells near straight wounds moved in straight lines, traveling parallel to the edges.The NTU team concluded that the swirling or vortex-like movement is crucial to gap bridging, in which cells build bridges to heal damaged tissues, and which accelerates the wound healing process in wavy wounds.This is the first time that the relationship between gap bridging, and the speed of wound healing has been determined, said the NTU team of their findings published on April 25 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).The scientists said their findings open the door to the development of more effective strategies to speed up wound healing, for better wound management, tissue repair, and plastic surgery.Professor K Jimmy Hsia, lead investigator and President's Chair in Mechanical Engineering, NTU School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering (MAE) and School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, said, \"Scientists have long known that the way you cut your skin affects how fast it heals. However, not much is known about why this happens, and the factors that could affect the healing speed. Our study contributes new knowledge to the promising field of mechanobiology, which could help surgeons develop better strategies for patients' wound care.\"Commenting as an independent expert, Lim Chwee Teck, National University of Singapore Society Chair Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute, said, \"Wound healing is a crucial but less understood process of patient recovery. This interesting study sheds light on wound healing under complex geometries, providing crucial information that can contribute towards faster wound healing with less scarring.\"                \u00a0(L-R) The research team include PhD student Zhou Quan, Prof K Jimmy Hsia, lead investigator and President's Chair in Mechanical Engineering, NTU School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering (MAE), PhD student Xu Hongmei and Co-lead investigator, Asst Prof Huang Changjin, NTU School of MAE.\u00a0 Credit: Nanyang Technological University             Different wound shapes induce different cell movementsAn essential component of wound healing is re-epithelialization, a process in which the epithelial cell\u2014a type of cell found on the skin\u2014moves to form a bridge between the wound and the skin, closing its gap.While previous studies have found that zig zag wounds healed faster than straight wounds, little is known about how different wound curvatures (shape) and wound sizes influence healing efficiency, nor about the mechanism of re-epithelialization.To investigate, the NTU scientists prepared synthetic wounds with a range of widths (30 micrometers to 100 micrometers) and curvatures (radius of curvature: 30 micrometers, 75 micrometers, 150 micrometers and straight line) to learn how cells moved to close wound gaps in different circumstances.Using particle image velocimetry\u2014an optical measurement technique for fluid flow\u2014researchers found that wavy wounds induced more complex collective cell movements, such as a swirly, vortex-like motion. By contrast in a straight wound, cells moved parallel to the wound front, moving in straight lines like a marching band.Wavy wounds heal nearly five times fasterThe NTU team also observed the healing progress of the synthetic wounds over a period of 64 hours and found that the healing efficiency of wavy gaps\u2014measured by the percentage area covered by the cells over time\u2014is nearly five times faster than straight gaps.First author of the study Xu Hongmei, a doctoral student at NTU School of MAE, said, \"The highly nonuniform and rotational motion induced by wavy wounds allowed more opportunities for cells to move around, compared to straight wounds. This enabled cells to quickly connect with similar cells on the opposite site of the wound edge, forming a bridge and closing the wavy wound gaps faster than straight gaps.\"Co-lead investigator, Assistant Professor Huang Changjin at NTU School of MAE, said, \"This study has revealed the cellular and molecular mechanisms of gap closure, contributing to the scientific understanding of the underlying principles of the wound-healing process. Clinicians and surgeons can use this knowledge to develop better strategies, such as incision methods, for patients' wound management care in future.\" More information:Hongmei Xu et al, Geometry-mediated bridging drives nonadhesive stripe wound healing, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

    "text": "Resistance to antibiotics is a problem that alarms the medical and scientific community. Bacteria resistant to three different classes of antibiotics, known as multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, are far from rare. Some are even resistant to all currently available treatments and are known as pan-drug resistant (PDR). They are associated with dangerous infections and listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as priority pathogens for drug development with maximum urgency.          An article published in a special issue of the journal Antibiotics highlights a compound with antibacterial activity that presented promising results within one hour in laboratory trials.The study was led by Ilana Camargo, last author of the article, and conducted during the doctoral research of first author Gabriela Righetto at the Molecular Epidemiology and Microbiology Laboratory (LEMiMo) of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's S\u00e3o Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC-USP) in Brazil.\"The compound we discovered is a new peptide, Pln149-PEP20, with a molecular framework designed to enhance its antimicrobial activity and with low toxicity. The results can be considered promising insofar as the trials involved pathogenic bacteria associated with MDR infections worldwide,\" said Adriano Andricopulo, a co-author of the article.Although novel antibacterial drugs are urgently needed, the pharmaceutical industry is notoriously uninterested in pursuing them, mainly because research in this field is time-consuming and costly, requiring very long lead times to bring viable active compounds to market.The Center for Innovation in Biodiversity and Drug Discovery (CIBFar), a Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC), looks for molecules that can be used to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria.Camargo and Andricopulo are researchers at CIBFar, as are two other co-authors who study promising bactericidal compounds: Leila Beltramini and Jos\u00e9 Luiz Lopes.For over a decade, the group formed by the collaboration between Beltramini and Lopes has analyzed Plantaricin 149 and its analogs. Plantaricins are substances produced by the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum to combat other bacteria.Lactobacillus plantarum is commonly found in nature, especially in anaerobic plant matter, and in many fermented vegetable, meat and dairy products.      In the case of Plantaricin 149, Japanese researchers were the first to report its bactericidal action (in 1994) and since then scientists have been interested in obtaining more efficient synthetic analogs (molecules with small structural differences).In 2007, one of the first projects completed by the CIBFar team showed that the peptide inhibits pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus spp. They then began studying synthetic analogs with stronger bactericidal activity than the original (causing more damage to the membrane of the combated microorganisms).Righetto synthesized 20 analogs of Plantaricin 149, finding that Pln149-PEP20 had the best results so far and was also half the size of the original peptide. \"The main advances in our research consist of the development of this smaller, more active and less toxic molecule, and the characterization of its action and propensity to develop resistance. It has proven to be highly promising in vitro\u2014active against MDR bacteria and extensively resistant bacteria,\" said Camargo, principal investigator for the project.LEMiMo, the laboratory where the studies were conducted, has experience in characterizing bacterial isolates involved in outbreaks of hospital infections and holds a collection of bacteria selected for these trials in search of novel active compounds. The bacteria have the resistance profiles currently of greatest concern and were isolated during hospital outbreaks.They are known in the scientific community by the term ESKAPE, an acronym for the scientific names of six highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.Further research can now be conducted to investigate the molecule's action mechanism in more depth, to look for formulations, and possibly to develop an application.\"In terms of the action mechanism, it's also possible to use the cell morphology of the bacteria to identify cellular pathways affected by the peptide,\" Righetto said. \"As for optimization, the molecule can be functionalized by being linked to macrostructures, and the amino acid sequence can be modified.\" Research is also needed on its cytotoxicity and on its selectivity (whether it affects healthy cells).\"We're living in times of major global public health hazards due to a lack of antimicrobials that can be used to treat infections caused by extremely resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides are targets of great interest for the development of novel candidate drugs. This novel molecule has the potential to be used as an innovative antimicrobial therapy, but further modifications and molecular optimizations still need to be investigated,\" Andricopulo said.

    "text": "Climate change will reduce the land available for coffee by 54% by 2100 even if global temperatures are contained to internationally agreed targets, according to a new report.          Coffee growers from Honduras to Ethiopia said they are already suffering from climate destabilization and the charity Christian Aid is calling on the U.K. Government to help by canceling historic debts and raising money to pay for climate loss and damage.The charity has calculated that rising temperatures and unpredictable conditions will shrink the world's land suitable for growing coffee by 54.4%, even if global temperatures are limited to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.More than half the coffee drank in the U.K. comes from Brazil and Vietnam, two countries particularly vulnerable to climate change.Vietnam clocked its highest ever temperature on record last week at 44.1 degrees Celsius (111.38 Fahrenheit), while neighboring countries also experienced new extremes.Rising temperatures, as well as erratic rainfall, disease, droughts and landslides brought on by human-induced climate change threaten to shrink the coffee industry and impoverish its producers.Yadira Lemus, a Honduran coffee farmer, said, \"As a coffee producer, it is more and more difficult to produce. And yes, that is obviously related to climate change because before we would plant coffee and it produced almost by itself.\"With regard to climate change, we are seeing an increase in temperature. It is harder to predict the weather. Before we could say which is winter or summer, and when we can plant. Not anymore.\"We cannot say that because it changes from one year to the other and it is not easy to predict. Who was going to predict that we were going to have the storms and hurricanes we had last year?\"Now you see there is a lack of rain. We are more vulnerable to these types of changes.\"Christian Aid issued its dire warning in a new report, Wake up and smell the coffee: The climate crisis and your coffee, which calls for a cancelation of \"unjust\" debts and financial support to help farmers diversify their livelihoods.Yitna Tekaligne, the charity's Ethiopia country manager, said, \"Africans make up 17% of the world's population but we generate just 4% of the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the climate crisis. And yet it is we who are suffering the brunt of the impacts of climate change.\"Our coffee industry is Ethiopia's most important export and generates significant employment. But now it is under threat from climate change.\"The impact of climate change on coffee production is in plain sight, including through high levels of coffee leaf rust.\"There is a lot the U.K. Government can do, starting with using its power to get Western private creditors to cancel the debts of the world's poorest countries and mobilizing the vital finance we need to address the loss and damage caused to our country by the climate crisis.\"David Taylor, Fairtrade Foundation's senior policy manager, said, \"This timely report from Christian Aid highlights what Fairtrade coffee farmers have been telling us for some time: the catastrophic consequences of climate breakdown is endangering not only their livelihoods, but also the future of their popular crop.\"Farming communities have a critical role in addressing the climate crisis and have the expertise to tackle it.\"However, too many smallholder coffee farmers\u2014particularly those without the financial protections Fairtrade offers\u2014simply cannot afford to do so, because the price they receive for their produce is far too low.

    "text": "A multi-institutional team of biologists and ecologists from Chile and Argentina has found evidence suggesting that electromagnetic fields emanating from electrical towers disrupt pollinating honeybees. The research is published in the journal Science Advances.          Prior research has suggested that electromagnetic radiation emitted from power lines may interfere with plants and animals in the vicinity\u2014though some have suggested that the unique habitat of the treeless regions where power lines pass through forests may confer some natural benefit.In this new effort, the research team focused specifically on the impact of electromagnetic radiation emitted from electrical towers on honeybees\u2014they chose honeybees because prior research has shown they navigate using natural electromagnetic fields. And they chose to use electrical towers rather than power lines themselves because they had access to similar towers without power lines, allowing for comparison purposes.The researchers first counted the number of poppies flowering around active towers and towers that were inactive\u2014they found there were far fewer flowering around the active towers. The researchers also measured the electromagnetic fields around multiple towers to discover how strong they were at various distances.They then collected several honeybee specimens flying at different distances from a tower and measured the levels of a protein called HsP70 in their bodies\u2014this protein has been shown to be related to stress in the bees. As expected, they found higher levels in the bees working closest to the electrical towers.The research team then collected more honeybee specimens at a distance from any towers or lines and brought them back to their lab for study. They exposed them to different amounts of electromagnetic radiation and then measured expressions related to 14 genes known to be associated with navigation, stress and the immune system. They found differences in 12 of those exposed to electromagnetic radiation.The team finished their study by once more venturing into the field to study the bees working closely to electrical towers\u2014they found that the frequency of visits to a nearest flower that were closest to a tower were approximately 308% lower than in areas where there were no towers.The group concludes that electromagnetic fields around electrical towers have a detrimental impact on honeybee pollination, and by extension, the surrounding plant community.

    "text": "New insights into the structure of phages will enable researchers to develop new uses for the viruses in biotechnology.          Phages are viruses that infect bacteria, which enables them to be exploited as tools in biotechnology and medicine. Now, for the first time, researchers at the University of Exeter, in collaboration with Massey University and Nanophage Technologies, New Zealand, have mapped out what a commonly-used form of phage looks like, which will help researchers design better uses in future.One common use for phage is phage display, which is a useful tool in drug discovery. Phage display works by linking a gene fragment of interest to a phage gene that makes one of the phage coat proteins. The new coat protein with the linked protein of interest appears on the surface of the phage, where it can be assayed and tested for biological activity.Billions of types of phages exist. Phage display often uses a type of phage known as filamentous, so called because they are long and thin, making the display of many proteins across its surface possible. Although phage display and other applications have proved successful, until now, scientists have not known what this type of phage looks like.For the first time, Dr. Vicki Gold at the University of Exeter, has revealed the structure of a filamentous phage, in research published in the journal Nature Communications. She said, \"Phages form part of a very exciting and growing area of research, with a range of current and potential applications. Yet until now, we've not had a complete picture of what filamentous phages look like. We've now provided the first view, and understanding this will help us improve applications for phage into the future.\"Because filamentous phages are so long, scientists have previously failed to capture an image of their entirety. To image the phage, researchers created smaller versions, which are around 10-fold shorter, which look like straight nanorods rather than entangled spaghetti-like filaments. This mini version was small enough to be imaged in its entirety using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy.The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

    "text": "The Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) is a pest species in France. It is found throughout the Mediterranean Basin as well as in Africa and the Middle East. Moth larvae are extremely polyphagous and cause damage to diverse crop species (e.g., corn, legumes, cotton, tomatoes, peppers).          As part of broader efforts to reduce pesticide levels, researchers must develop effective biocontrol methods. Such strategies often rely on disrupting reproduction and trapping moths using, most commonly, sex pheromones. However, pheromone synthesis is an expensive process, and it thus remains important to have other control strategies on hand. To this end, researchers need to improve their understanding of olfactory receptors in this moth.In 2019, researchers identified OR5, an olfactory receptor in the Egyptian cotton leafworm that recognizes the main compound in the female sex pheromone blend. In this new study, the same scientists explored the receptor's evolutionary trajectory within Spodoptera to better characterize its functionality and specificity.They used a combined approach in which they resurrected ancestral receptors in the laboratory, with the help of computer analysis, and they modeled the 3D structure of the receptors. They were thus able to determine that OR5 appeared around 7 million years ago. The researchers also employed site-directed mutagenesis to explore OR5's genetic fine-tuning, which allowed them to identify the eight amino acids (AAs) behind the receptor's high degree of specificity.This finding is particularly unexpected, given that past research on receptor evolution has suggested just one or two AA substitutions suffice to change the functionality of ecologically important receptors.Researchers must clarify how olfactory receptors emerge and acquire specificity over evolutionary time if they wish to anticipate the development of resistance to pheromone-based plant protection products. This research advances the above goal and, additionally, clarifies the function of OR5, a highly specific receptor that is essential in the reproduction of two Spodoptera species\u2014the Egyptian cotton leafworm and the tobacco cutworm (S. litura).The latter occurs mostly in Asia and is also polyphagous. The discoveries detailed above will help spur the development of new biocontrol strategies that rely on (1) agonist molecules, which occupy receptors to the exclusion of the key pheromone compound, or (2) antagonist molecules, which block the receptor from being activated by the key pheromone compound.The paper is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

    "text": "About 100 million years ago, a group of trendsetting moths started flying during the day rather than at night, taking advantage of nectar-rich flowers that had co-evolved with bees. This single event led to the evolution of all butterflies.          Scientists have known the precise timing of this event since 2019, when a large-scale analysis of DNA discounted an earlier hypothesis that pressure from bats prompted the evolution of butterflies after the extinction of dinosaurs.Now, scientists have discovered where the first butterflies originated and which plants they relied on for food.Before reaching these conclusions, researchers from dozens of countries had to create the world's largest butterfly tree of life, assembled with DNA from more than 2,000 species representing all butterfly families and 92% of genera. Using this framework as a guide, they traced the movements and feeding habits of butterflies through time in a four-dimensional puzzle that led back to North and Central America. According to their results, published May 15 in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, this is where the first butterflies took flight.For lead author Akito Kawahara, curator of lepidoptera at the Florida Museum of Natural History, the project was a long time coming.\"This was a childhood dream of mine,\" he said. \"It's something I've wanted to do since visiting the American Museum of Natural History when I was a kid and seeing a picture of a butterfly phylogeny taped to a curator's door. It's also the most difficult study I've ever been a part of, and it took a massive effort from people all over the world to complete.\"There are some 19,000 butterfly species, and piecing together the 100 million-year history of the group required information about their modern distributions and host plants. Prior to this study, there was no single place that researchers could go to access that type of data.\"In many cases, the information we needed existed in field guides that hadn't been digitized and were written in various languages,\" Kawahara said.Undeterred, the authors decided to make their own, publicly available database, painstakingly translating and transferring the contents of books, museum collections and isolated web pages into a single digital repository.      Underlying all these data were 11 rare butterfly fossils, without which the analysis would not have been possible. With paper-thin wings and threadlike, gossamer hairs, butterflies are rarely preserved in the fossil record. The few that are can be used as calibration points on genetic trees, allowing researchers to record timing of key evolutionary events.The results tell a dynamic story\u2014one rife with rapid diversifications, faltering advances and improbable dispersals. Some groups traveled over impossibly vast distances while others seem to have stayed in one place, remaining stationary while continents, mountains and rivers moved around them.Butterflies first appeared somewhere in Central and western North America. At the time, North America was bisected by an expansive seaway that split the continent in two, while present-day Mexico was joined in a long arc with the United States, Canada and Russia. North and South America hadn't yet joined via the Isthmus of Panama, but butterflies had little difficulty crossing the strait between them.Despite the relatively close proximity of South America to Africa, butterflies took the long way around, moving into Asia across the Bering Land Bridge. From there, they quickly covered ground, radiating into Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. They even made it to India, which was then an isolated island, separated by miles of open sea on all sides.Even more astonishing was their arrival in Australia, which remained sutured to Antarctica, the last combined remnant of the supercontinent Pangaea. It's possible butterflies once lived in Antarctica when global temperatures were warmer, making their way across the continent's northern edge into Australia before the two landmasses separated.Farther north, butterflies lingered on the edge of western Asia for potentially up to 45 million years before finally migrating into Europe. The reason for this extended pause is unclear, but its effects are still apparent today, Kawahara explained.\"Europe doesn't have many butterfly species compared to other parts of the world, and the ones it does have can often be found elsewhere. Many butterflies in Europe are also found in Siberia and Asia, for example.\"Once butterflies had become established, they quickly diversified alongside their plant hosts. By the time dinosaurs were snuffed out 66 million years ago, nearly all modern butterfly families had arrived on the scene, and each one seems to have had a special affinity for a specific group of plants.\"We looked at this association over an evolutionary timescale, and in pretty much every family of butterflies, bean plants came out to be the ancestral hosts,\" Kawahara said. \"This was true in the ancestor of all butterflies as well.\"Bean plants have since increased their roster of pollinators to include various bees, flies, hummingbirds and mammals, while butterflies have similarly expanded their palate. According to study co-author Pamela Soltis, a Florida Museum curator and distinguished professor, the botanical partnerships that butterflies forged helped transform them from minor offshoot of moths to what is today one of the world's largest groups of insects.\"The evolution of butterflies and flowering plants has been inexorably intertwined since the origin of the former, and the close relationship between them has resulted in remarkable diversification events in both lineages,\" she said.

    "text": "On the beach. In the ocean. Traveling along riverways. In muggy Florida and chilly Ireland. Even floating through the air.          We cough, spit, shed and flush our DNA into all of these places and countless more. Signs of human life can be found nearly everywhere, short of isolated islands and remote mountaintops, according to a new University of Florida study.That ubiquity is both a scientific boon and an ethical dilemma, say the UF researchers who sequenced this widespread DNA. The DNA was of such high quality that the scientists could identify mutations associated with disease and determine the genetic ancestry of nearby populations. They could even match genetic information to individual participants who had volunteered to have their errant DNA recovered.David Duffy, the UF professor of wildlife disease genomics who led the project, says that ethically handled environmental DNA samples could benefit fields from medicine and environmental science to archaeology and criminal forensics. For example, researchers could track cancer mutations from wastewater or spot undiscovered archaeological sites by checking for hidden human DNA. Or detectives could identify suspects from the DNA floating in the air of a crime scene.

Credit: Todd Osbourne             But this level of personal information must be handled extremely carefully. Now, scientists and regulators must grapple with the ethical dilemmas inherent in accidentally\u2014or intentionally\u2014sweeping up human genetic information, not from blood samples but from a scoop of sand, a vial of water or a person's breath.Published May 15 in Nature Ecology and Evolution, the paper by Duffy's group outlines the relative ease of collecting human DNA nearly everywhere they looked.\"We've been consistently surprised throughout this project at how much human DNA we find and the quality of that DNA,\" Duffy said. \"In most cases the quality is almost equivalent to if you took a sample from a person.\"      Because of the ability to potentially identify individuals, the researchers say that ethical guardrails are necessary for this kind of research. The study was conducted with approval from the institutional review board of UF, which ensures that ethical guidelines are adhered to during research studies.

Credit: Jenny Whilde             \"It's standard in science to make these sequences publicly available. But that also means if you don't screen out human information, anyone can come along and harvest this information,\" Duffy said. \"That raises issues around consent. Do you need to get consent to take those samples? Or institute some controls to remove human information?\"Duffy's team at UF's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience and Sea Turtle Hospital has successfully used environmental DNA, or eDNA, to study endangered sea turtles and the viral cancers they are susceptible to. They've plucked useful DNA out of turtle tracks in the sand, greatly accelerating their research program.The scientists knew that human eDNA would end up in their turtle samples and probably many other places they looked. With modern genetic sequencing technology, it's now straightforward to sequence the DNA of every organism in an environmental sample. The questions were how much human DNA there would be and whether it was intact enough to harbor useful information.The team found quality human DNA in the ocean and rivers surrounding the Whitney Lab, both near town and far from human settlement, as well as in sand from isolated beaches. In a test facilitated by the National Park Service, the researchers traveled to part of a remote island never visited by people. It was free of human DNA, as expected. But they were able to retrieve DNA from voluntary participants' footprints in the sand and could sequence parts of their genomes, with permission from the anonymous participants.Duffy also tested the technique in his native Ireland. Tracing along a river that winds through town on its way to the ocean, Duffy found human DNA everywhere but the remote mountain stream where the river starts, far from civilization.The scientists also collected room air samples from a veterinary hospital. They recovered DNA matching the staff, the animal patient and common animal viruses.Now that it's clear human eDNA can be readily sampled, Duffy says it's time for policymakers and scientific communities to take issues around consent and privacy seriously and balance them against the possible benefits of studying this errant DNA.\"Any time we make a technological advance, there are beneficial things that the technology can be used for and concerning things that the technology can be used for. It's no different here,\" Duffy said. \"These are issues we are trying to raise early so policy makers and society have time to develop regulations.\" More information:David Duffy, Inadvertent human genomic bycatch and intentional capture raise beneficial applications and ethical concerns with environmental DNA, Nature Ecology & Evolution (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the ray that is highly mobile?",
    "text": "Clam leases are designated underwater locations used to produce hard clams of all sizes from littlenecks to chowders. Clam production or aquaculture can be a risky business due in part to unwanted marine intruders. Among them, stealthy and highly mobile rays.          The Indian River Lagoon is one key location used for hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) aquaculture operations along Florida's Atlantic coast. Clam fishermen have anecdotally reported seeing rays in clam leases and suspect that their interactions could result in damaged aquaculture gear and crushed clams. After all, some species of rays are equipped with mighty jaws and plate-like teeth that make them highly capable culprits.Inspired by clammer reports, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and collaborators, used passive acoustic telemetry to gauge the interactions between two highly mobile animals, whitespotted eagle rays (Aetobatus narinari) and cownose rays (Rhinoptera spp.) in two clam lease sites and four other sites in Sebastian, including the Sebastian Inlet and the Saint Sebastian River mouth.Since visual observations can be challenging and unpredictable, this technology enabled researchers to monitor the tagged rays in the wild over two years.\"We wanted to understand how often and when rays visited these clam leases, how long they stayed there, and if it was seasonal or year-round,\" said Matt Ajemian, Ph.D., senior author, an associate research professor and director of the Fisheries Ecology and Conservation Lab at FAU Harbor Branch. \"We tagged them, set them on their way and logged 17,014 unique visits to the leases derived from 38 different rays.\"Findings from the study, published in PLOS ONE, provide both good news and bad news for clammers. Rays spent even more time in these clam lease sites than clammers reported or suspected, but it's not necessarily where they prefer hanging out. For example, whitespotted eagle rays spent only 6.2 percent of their time near clam lease locations and cownose rays 13.2 percent.                Researchers shown with a whitespotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari), a highly mobile animal with a mighty jaw and plate-like teeth. Credit: Florida Atlantic University/Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute             Predicting when and for how long rays visit the clam leases also was complicated as it depended on the species, time of day, season, and even certain environmental conditions. Despite less frequent use when compared to other reference receiver locations, both species of rays exhibited longer visits at clam lease sites than some locations considered and were periodically observed within the clam lease regions for extended periods of time.      The longest continuous duration spent at the northern and southern clam leases were 387.5 and 207.1 minutes, respectively. This shows that rays can remain within these areas for hours at a time, which increases the likelihood in which they are interacting with, and potentially foraging upon, the clam leases.\"Since 84 percent of all visits were from whitespotted eagle rays and their visits were significantly longer at night, this information suggests that observed interactions with the clam leases are potentially underestimated, given most clamming operations occur during daytime,\" said Brianna Cahill, corresponding author, an FAU Harbor Branch marine science and oceanography graduate, and a research technician at Stony Brook University.\"Results from our study justify the need to continue monitoring mobile predators in the region, including more studies to assess their behaviors such as foraging at the clam lease sites.\"Cownose rays and whitespotted eagle rays have different migratory patterns, but in both cases their tendency to be mobile may limit their impacts on clammers.\"Additional good news for clammers is that rays did not use the clam lease sites year-round, and their visits varied seasonally, with substantially fewer detections and visits during the summer months,\" said Ajemian. \"This suggests that clammers need only deploy anti-predator protections against rays, if needed, for a portion of the year.\"Findings from the study also highlight the need to understand if clam leases are situated within rays' natural foraging habitats and if rays are actively interacting with the clam leases or if they may be attracted to other organisms nearby.\"It's possible that rays may be feeding on other organisms that are attracted to the clams in the clam lease sites, as bivalve aquaculture farms have been known to change community structure and attract a wide variety of predatory snails, that may be an alternative attractant for cownose and whitespotted eagle rays given their diets,\" said Cahill.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the symbiotic relationship between anemones and corals?",
    "text": "Tropical oceans are typically nutrient-poor, yet they host vast biologically diverse reef ecosystems built by symbiotic cnidarians (including corals and anemones). This apparent contradiction, known as the Darwin Paradox, has puzzled scientists since it was first described by Charles Darwin in 1842.          Now, an international study, published in Science Advances and led by KAUST researchers, has demonstrated how the sea anemone Aiptasia distributes the sugar it receives from its symbionts to recycle nitrogen waste efficiently throughout its body, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.\"Many previous studies focused on the ocean environment to discover where the limited nutrients come from\u2014particularly nitrogen, which is very scarce,\" says research scientist Guoxin Cui, who worked on the project under the supervision of Manuel Aranda.\"Some coral-based studies hypothesized that coral-algae symbiosis generated these ecological hotspots. However, the underlying molecular mechanism enabling cnidarians to build these massive ecosystems remained elusive,\" Cui says.Cui was particularly interested in examining the symbiotic relationship at the tissue level. Cnidarians have a simple tissue structure consisting of two major cell layers: the gastrodermis and the epidermis. Only the inner layer, the gastrodermis, forms the intracellular relationship with algae.First, the team adapted a laser microdissection technique to separate the two tissue layers of Aiptasia and study tissue-specific gene expression. Using emerging single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, they investigated the RNA transcription profiles associated with symbiosis at fine cellular scales. This is the first time such techniques have been used to study symbiosis in sea anemones.The approach allowed the researchers to identify the key transporters involved in nitrogen assimilation, before using antibody staining to track the localization of these nutrient transporters within the anemone.\"We found that the anemone changes the expression and localization of nutrient transporters to distribute the glucose it receives from its symbionts across all of its tissues,\" says Aranda. \"It uses most of its body mass to recycle the nitrogen waste produced, alongside processing any ammonium that is available in the environment.\"The symbiotic relationship turns the whole organism into a nitrogen assimilator, notes Cui. \"This challenges the widespread belief that algae are the sole actors in nitrogen assimilation; the anemone also plays a major role in recycling this scarce nutrient. They form a single inseparable meta-organism.\"The team hope that this study provides the basis for creating better selective breeding methods and may inform efforts to safeguard reef ecosystems. They are expanding their research to examine symbiotic relationships across different cnidarian taxa and ecological contexts.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the study that found corals are spawning one to three days closer to the full moon than on unlit reefs?",
    "text": "The light pollution caused by coastal cities can trick coral reefs into spawning outside of the optimum times when they would normally reproduce, a new study has found.          Coral broadcast spawning events\u2014in which lunar cycles trigger the release of eggs on certain nights of the year\u2014are critical to the maintenance and recovery of reefs following mass bleaching and other similar events.However, using a combination of light pollution data and spawning observations, researchers were able to show for the first time that corals exposed to artificial light at night (ALAN) are spawning one to three days closer to the full moon compared to those on unlit reefs.Spawning on different nights could reduce the likelihood of coral eggs being fertilized and surviving to produce new adult corals that help reefs to recover after bleaching events and other disturbances.The research, published in Nature Communications, is the latest to be carried out as part of the Artificial Light Impacts on Coastal Ecosystems (ALICE) project.It builds on research published in December 2021 that mapped out the areas of the ocean most affected by light pollution.That study found that at a depth of one meter, 1.9 million sq km of coastal ocean are exposed to biologically important ALAN (around 3.1% of the global Exclusive Economic Zones).For the new study, researchers paired that data with a global dataset of 2,135 coral spawning observations from the 21st century.This enabled them to demonstrate that ALAN is possibly advancing the triggers for spawning by creating a perceived period of minimum illuminance between sunset and moonrise on nights following the full moon.Dr. Thomas Davies, lecturer in marine conservation at the University of Plymouth, is the study's lead author and also principal investigator of the ALICE project. He said, \"Corals are critical for the health of the global ocean, but are being increasingly damaged by human activity. This study shows it is not just changes in the ocean that are impacting them, but the continued development of coastal cities as we try and accommodate the growing global population.      \"If we want to mitigate against the harm this is causing, we could perhaps look to delay the switching on of night-time lighting in coastal regions to ensure the natural dark period between sunset and moonrise that triggers spawning remains in tact. That would potentially raise a number of economic and safety issues, but is something we potentially need to consider to ensure our coral reefs are given the best chance of survival.\"Dr. Tim Smyth, head of science for marine biogeochemistry and observations at Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the study's senior author, added, \"This study further emphasizes the importance of artificial light pollution as a stressor of coastal and marine ecosystems, with the impacts on various aspects of biodiversity only now being discovered and quantified. A critical first step along that path was enabled with our global in-water light pollution atlas which highlighted for the first time the true extent of the problem, which hitherto had gone unrecognized.\"The study looked at coastal regions all over the world, but coral reefs in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf are particularly affected by light pollution.They are areas where coastlines have been heavily developed in recent years and where coral reefs are both close to the shore and at particular risk.Co-author Professor Oren Levy, who heads the Laboratory for Molecular Marine Ecology at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, added, \"The Red Sea and the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba are heavily impacted by Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) due to urbanization and the proximity of the reefs to the coastline. Despite the challenges posed by ALAN, corals in the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba are known for their thermal tolerance and ability to withstand high temperatures. However, a disturbance in the timing of coral spawning with the moon phases can result in a decline in new coral recruits and a reduction in the coral population.\"It is crucial that we take immediate action to reduce the impact of ALAN on these fragile marine ecosystems. By implementing measures to limit light pollution, we can protect these vital habitats and safeguard the future of the world's oceans.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the 3D system used to study embryo development?",
    "text": "Building on previous efforts to create a platform for the extended study of primate embryos in cell culture, two new reports from the State Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Kunming University of Science and Technology in China, present a three-dimensional suspension structure that allows for more normal development and detailed observation of embryogenesis. The reports are published in Cell.          The first paper, \"Neurulation of the cynomolgus monkey embryo achieved from 3D blastocyst culture,\" describes a study of gestational neurodevelopmental in a nonhuman model. The paper details a lab culturing system that allowed researchers to develop monkey embryonic cells from the blastocyst stage to the neurula stage at day 25 post-fertilization. The researchers then used this model to investigate neural tube development.Neural tube defects (NTDs) are globally common birth defects of the brain, spine or spinal cord that present in fetuses within the first month of pregnancy. NTDs are strongly linked to folate (folic acid) deficiency, which is why folate supplements are commonly recommended before and during pregnancy.While correlative relationships are known, the mechanisms of neurulation remain hidden mainly due to prohibitions on human embryo research and limitations of available model systems. This is true of many developmental stages and pathologies that could be studied with human embryonic tissues.Working with macaque monkey embryos, the researchers established a three-dimensional prolonged in vitro culture (pIVC) system to study embryo development from seven to 25 days post-fertilization.Through single-cell multi-omics analyses, the study demonstrates that pIVC embryos form three germ layers, including primordial germ cells, and establish proper DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility through advanced gastrulation stages. In addition, immunofluorescence confirmed neural crest formation, neural tube closure, and neural progenitor regionalization.The transcriptional profiles and morphogenetics of these pIVC embryos resemble key features of similarly staged in vivo macaque and human embryos. With this non-human primate model, researchers can further investigate the mechanisms operating on NTDs in embryogenesis through advanced gastrulation and early neurulation and apply other research targets to the model system.In the second paper, \"Ex utero monkey embryogenesis from blastocyst to early organogenesis,\" researchers at Kunming University used the same lab-based culturing platform to track other developmental milestones during the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy, culminating in the formation of ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm and the initial formation of various organs.Previous non-three-dimensional cultivation of embryonic tissues failed to allow for early organogenesis, as the cell structures would collapse as soon as they began forming. According to the authors, \"Ex utero monkey embryogenesis offers an easily accessible, tractable, and perturbable platform to dissect key developmental events beyond gastrulation stages in primates.\"The researchers of the second study call the embedded 3D culture system the Enhanced Monkey Ex Utero Culture (EMEUC) system. This system used Geltrex and Matrigel for mechanical support and glucose as an additional energy supply. These optimizations helped maintain the structural integrity of monkey embryos during extended culturing and allowed the tissue to form most of the expected features compared to in vivo formation.The next step will be to add agitated motion to the model to see if they can further improve developmental stage formations by better simulating a natural environment.      The 14-day rule Current research on human embryos is limited to the first 14 days or less, depending on the state of development. The specific legal and regulatory language can differ (gastrulation, formation of the primitive streak, 14 consecutive days) depending on where the research occurs, though it all amounts to the same limit.The method used in the studies offers researchers a potential workaround for studying human development with a platform of embryogenesis in primates. It will be possible to track the movements, organization and lineages of the embryonic cells late into development, which may have enough conservation with human embryogenesis to act as a research proxy.The combined implication of the current papers is that of a lab-based workaround that may be the best non-human primate analog model currently available to study early embryonic development, as well as a platform that is prepared to make future research on human embryos more efficient, especially if the 14-day rule is ever reconsidered or replaced with something more conducive to solving the mysteries of developmental pathologies.

    "text": "With excitement in their voices, six birdwatchers raise binoculars and scan the treetops in a private sanctuary not far from Venezuela's capital Caracas.          Look, one says, there's a blue-gray tanager. Another spots a warbler.At the break of dawn, the birdwatchers left Caracas to take part in Global Big Day, an annual worldwide celebration in which birders observe as many species as they can in a 24-hour period.Leading the group was Rosaelena Albornoz, a 61-year-old bird guide who has studied birds in Venezuela for nearly three decades.Emotions were high as the group arrived at Amaranta Hummingbird House, a private sanctuary in San Jose de los Altos in the state of Miranda where some 170 species of birds have been spotted.\"Birds are an indicator of the health of an ecosystem,\" Albornoz tells AFP as she tallies the species they spot to upload on Ebird (ebird.org/), the platform to register bird sightings worldwide.\"With Global Big Day... the public comes out to have fun with the birds by counting them,\" says Albornoz, who left a job as an executive to study birds.Hummingbirds fly over flowers and feeders set up by retired physician Cecilia Martinez, owner of Amaranta Hummingbird House.                Bird guide Rosaelena Albornoz (L) records bird songs as other birdwatchers identify species for the Global Big Day.             A large hummingbird known as a brown violetear (Colibri delphinae) flies to Martinez to sip from a cup containing sugar water.\"Where have you been? Did you forget all about me?\" she coos to the bird.The fluttering hummingbird returns time and again to sip from the cup, as if she were a longtime friend of Martinez.\"Hummingbirds are capable of recognizing one,\" says Martinez, 73, a pathologist who retired in 2012 and now spends her time preserving the cloud forest tract near her home.'Light pollution'Serenity envelops this mountain reserve\u2014except for the squawking of the Rufous-vented Chachalaca, a ground-dwelling bird with a squeaky shrill call.Yet Martinez and other keen birdwatchers worry. They say human encroachment and light pollution are affecting birds and the insects they need for nourishment.                    A Lesser Violetear hummingbird (Colibri cyanotus) hovers near a feeder.                                     A Lineated woodpecker perches on a branch at the Amaranta Hummingbird House reserve.                                     Participants in the Global Big Day spot birds at the reserve in San Jose de Los Altos, Venezuela.                 \"The idea would be to study light pollution and the grave effect it has had on the loss of insects,\" says Albornoz. \"If white light does in the insects, it will diminish the number of pollinators and birds.\"She says the impact on birds and insects might be akin to how disrupted a human would feel if he or she had to sleep each night with a bright light on nearby.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Birdwatchers' hearts flutter for Global Big Day (2023, May 14)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-birdwatchers-hearts-flutter-global-big.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the migratory bird species that nests in the northern U.S. and southern Canada?",
    "text": "Let's start with the bad news. Current conservation practices likely won't do enough to save the black tern, a migratory bird species that nests in the northern U.S. and southern Canada, from disappearing.          That's according to new research from Michigan State University and the National Audubon Society published in the journal Biological Conservation. But there's also good news.The team's report reveals new opportunities to enhance the outlook for these birds by strategically expanding conservation and land management practices that can be used by landowners and agencies such as the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.Furthermore, the team's approach can be adapted to inform conservation practices for other species.Currently, black tern conservation efforts are focused on maintaining and restoring the bird's breeding habitat to ensure there's a place for the next generation to take flight. It's a sensible approach, but it also relies on adults surviving their migratory and overwintering periods.As the team showed, that survival can't be taken for granted.\"What's going on outside the breeding season and away from the breeding grounds is really important for this bird and, likely, other migratory species,\" said Kayla Davis, first author of the new report and a doctoral student in the College of Natural Science at MSU. \"There are things we can do to protect stopover and overwintering areas to increase adult survival.\"\"Fortunately, Audubon's network of members and centers allows us to have an expansive conservation reach,\" said Sarah Saunders, co-author of the study and senior manager of quantitative science at the National Audubon Society. \"Thanks to this work, now we know where to target efforts to help recover this species more effectively.\"Plight of the black ternBetween 1966 and 2019, the population of black terns across North America dropped by more than 2% every year, according to estimates from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. When looking at populations in Michigan, the drop is more than 7% annually.People knew the bird was vanishing, but prior to this collaboration between MSU and Audubon, researchers faced challenges developing reliable projections for how the black tern population would respond to different conservation strategies.Those challenges were largely rooted in how hard it is to observe the birds, Davis said.Black terns nest in wetlands, which are difficult to navigate. On top of that, these habitats are becoming smaller, more fragmented and less hospitable for numerous reasons including climate change, invasive species and land development.Furthermore, the birds themselves are finicky, Davis explained. Black terns are known to abandon nesting sites when confronted with perturbations that wouldn't ruffle feathers for other species\u2014say, changes in water levels or the appearance of a predator like a raccoon.\"If something upsets them when they're building a colony, they'll just up and leave,\" Davis said. \"And you don't know where they go.\"As a result, data on black terns are sparse, limiting the precision of computational models used to inform conservation practices. But Davis works in the lab of Elise Zipkin, an associate professor of integrative biology and the director of the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior program, or EEB, at MSU.One of the Zipkin lab's specialties is developing and implementing models for species lacking data.\"Because of data limitations, assessing wildlife trends is often only possible for common or easily identifiable species,\" said Zipkin. \"Our lab is interested in developing approaches that make use of every piece of available information so that we can tackle those tough questions on rare and elusive species,\" said Zipkin.Still, the black tern was an extreme case.\"At the beginning, we were definitely concerned about whether this would work, if we were going to have enough data to tell a story,\" Davis said.Thankfully, the MSU researchers had partnered with one of the world's foremost conservation societies.      A new approachStaff and volunteers with Detroit Audubon and Audubon Great Lakes\u2014regional offices of the National Audubon Society\u2014were able to gather valuable data about black terns through a variety of methods.That included visual counts of adults and juveniles, but also more intensive mark-recapture data. For these data, technicians catch birds and put small bands on their legs which allows the team to see if specific animals return to the nesting site in future breeding seasons.The Audubon researchers also used what are called nanotags, miniature radiofrequency devices that are designed to fall off the birds after several months. These tags provided useful data on how many fledglings survived a breeding season and where those birds traveled during their fall migrations.\"Black terns face an uncertain future in Michigan,\" said Erin Rowan, Michigan conservation manager for Audubon Great Lakes and a co-author of the study. \"By tracking whether black terns successfully fledge and depart their breeding grounds, we can better understand whether the cause of their population decline is from low chick productivity or low adult survivorship.\"For this project, the researchers worked at a breeding colony at the St. Clair Flats State Wildlife Area, near where the base of Michigan's thumb region connects to Canada. This site is actively managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, another key partner in this project.Starting with this single site, which hosts the largest black tern breeding colony in the Great Lakes, the team could vet its new approach while drawing meaningful conclusions.Usually, each data set that the team collected would be analyzed with its own separate model. This approach is useful but limited, especially when dealing with a species that doesn't make data collection easy.For this project, using what's known as an integrated population model, the team was able to bring typically disparate data together under a single analytical framework.Though the data were still scant, the researchers could examine the information in a more cohesive way, revealing more about the population dynamics of Michigan black terns.\"This way, we can make our estimates more accurate and precise than we could with any other model individually,\" Davis said.Based on its analysis, the team estimated that the average number of adult tern breeding pairs at St. Clair Flats dropped from more than 300 in 2013 to roughly 50 in 2022. The results show that promoting adult survival at other important areas along their migration\u2014such as where birds rest and spend their winters\u2014may be necessary in addition to current efforts that protect breeding sites.\"Of course, continuing to manage black tern breeding sites is important, too,\" said Stephanie Beilke, Audubon Great Lakes senior manager of conservation science and a co-author of the report. \"We need a collaborative approach to saving this species and that means connecting with partners abroad and at home.\"Another key takeaway from this project is simply that the team's approach worked, which is good news for species beyond the black tern.\"To be able to say something about conservation and land management implications with so little data is really encouraging because there are so many species out there that are data deficient,\" Davis said. \"This modeling framework is really powerful.\" More information:Kayla L.

    "question_squad": " What is the largest stomach compartment in ruminants?",
    "text": "Ruminants like cows have developed an unusual way of digesting their food: they ingest plants, give them a rough chewing and then swallow the half-chewed mash before regurgitating it repeatedly and continuing to chew. This has clear advantages, as a research team including the University of G\u00f6ttingen has shown: the regurgitated mushy food contains much less hard grit, sand and dust than the food that they first ingested.          This process also protects the teeth from being ground down during the chewing process. This may explain why the crowns of the teeth of ruminants are less pronounced than those of other herbivores. The findings have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS).The researchers fed four cows grass feed mixed with sand for several days and took samples of the regurgitated food pulp and feces. They then measured the silicate content of each sample. The compounds from sand and grass are particularly abrasive to teeth because of their hardness. The feces contained about the same amount of silicates as the grass feed mixed with sand, whereas the regurgitated food contained significantly less.The only explanation is that the silicates must have stayed in the stomach, or more precisely in the \"rumen.\" The rumen is the largest stomach compartment in ruminants and the place where food is fermented and broken down by microorganisms.Because this laborious chewing is partly carried out on food pulp that has been \"washed\" in the rumen, the teeth of ruminants are less worn than those of horses, for example. The latter chew their food completely after ingestion, including the abrasive bits.                The skull of a cow shows that its teeth have relatively low crowns compared to other herbivores who haven't evolved the same method of digestion. Credit: J\u00fcrgen Hummel             For the researchers, this observation makes sense because the teeth of ruminants have comparatively low crowns. The method of digestion means the teeth remain functional for longer. It explains the distinctive shape of ruminant's teeth: there has been no evolutionary pressure to form more tooth material.\"Our research explains a fundamental but little-studied aspect of food grinding in large herbivores, which contributes to the understanding of the function and evolution of teeth,\" explains Professor J\u00fcrgen Hummel, the University of G\u00f6ttingen's Ruminant Nutrition Group.In addition to understanding the physiology of digestion, the result is interesting for paleontology: teeth are well preserved as fossils and often provide the most important clues in reconstructing early herbivores and their environment.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the study that looked at the number of antimicrobials to which E. coli is resistant?",
    "text": "The spread of drug-resistant microbes has become a global health concern that threatens our ability to treat infections. The widespread use of antimicrobials in livestock, such as swine farms, exacerbates this problem. Therefore, we need surveillance systems to monitor these microbes to support the public health authorities. To this end, researchers have tracked the antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from swine.          Antimicrobials are essential for preventing and treating infections in humans and animals. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, 70% of all antibiotic sales in the US are used for livestock production. However, microbes change over time to combat these chemicals, eventually becoming resistant. As a result, infections become harder to treat. Concerningly, these resistant organisms can spread from farm animals to humans, creating a bigger health crisis.The researchers focused on E. coli since these bacteria are ubiquitous in the intestinal tract of humans and pigs, and they are good indicators to test whether meat and meat products have been contaminated. E. coli can also acquire and transfer resistance genes to other bacteria in the intestinal tract, making them ideal for monitoring programs of livestock and humans.\"It is important to monitor the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the swine industry because in 2022 the US was the third largest producer and consumer of swine meat and products, after the European Union and China,\" said Hamid Reza Sodagari, a postdoctoral research associate in the Varga lab. \"Although it is a big problem, to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first surveillance study in the US that looks at antimicrobial resistance in E. coli from swine at slaughter.\"The study used publicly available surveillance data of cecal samples, which were collected from the intestine after slaughter. The researchers focused on market swine and sows in the US between 2013 and 2019, and used the data compiled by the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety Inspection Service under the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria program.\"Federal agencies often don't have the manpower to carry out such long-term and detailed analyses. Alternatively, for most researchers such studies are challenging because usually they track samples on a smaller scale. In this paper, however, we were able to look at more than 3,000 samples across several years,\" said Csaba Varga (IGOH), an assistant professor of epidemiology.Using different statistical methods, the researchers found that since 2013, the number of antimicrobials to which E. coli is resistant has either remained steady or increased over the years. In particular, the resistance to ceftriaxone, an important antimicrobial drug in both human and veterinary medicine, increased from 0.8% in 2013 to 7.7% in 2019. Even though these numbers are not high compared to the resistance to other antimicrobials, the increasing trend is concerning.\"We don't know why there is an increasing trend. It may be caused by mobile genetic elements, which can transfer antimicrobial resistance from one bacterium to another. We need to do further research at the molecular level to understand the reason for the increase,\" Sodagari said.\"We are not blaming anyone for this problem. Our study is meant to show that there is an issue and that surveillance systems are very important to show the changes in resistance,\" Varga said. \"By gathering this data, we hope that the public health authorities will be able to develop mitigation strategies.\"The study \"Evaluating Antimicrobial Resistance Trends in Commensal Escherichia coli Isolated from Cecal Samples of Swine at Slaughter in the United States, 2013-2019\" was published in Microorganisms.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the food distribution center in Skid Row?",
    "text": "There is always something growing inside the gated courtyard of the L.A. Catholic Worker Hospitality Kitchen, the Skid Row food distribution center better known as the \"Hippie Kitchen.\"          But this spring has super-charged the courtyard's trees and lush greenery, which offer shade and sanctuary to the hundreds of neighborhood residents who come for the kitchen's thrice-weekly meals.\"This plant here\u2014I've never seen so many flowers on it,\" marveled organizer Matt Harper, pointing to the berry-like blooms on a natal lily.Magenta explosions of bougainvillea frothed over the kitchen's gates and the cinder-block walls of the vacant lot next door. The Indian coral tree's fire-colored blossoms popped against green leaves. There was even a calla lily blooming from a patch of dirt everyone at the kitchen thought had gone barren.\"We used to have all sorts of lovely flowers here, and then they all died off,\" Harper said, looking down at the unexpected blossom. \"But with all these rains you realize\u2014the bulbs are there. They're just waiting to bloom. Nature will take care of itself.\"Everything is growing everywhere all at once in Southern California.The lush greenery in city parks, the mustard flowers electrifying the hillsides, the burst of unexpected blossoms from carefully tended gardens and sidewalk cracks alike\u2014all of it is thanks to an ideal balance of precipitation and temperature that has catalyzed plant growth across the state.Those 31 atmospheric rivers delivered steady, nourishing rainfall from October to March. Regional temperatures remained moderate as well, without any sudden early-spring heat waves to kill off fragile baby plants.The combination of those two factors has produced \"an absolutely glorious spring,\" one that has been more vibrantly colorful for longer than any in recent memory, said Jeremy Yoder, a Cal State Northridge biologist.Roses have thorns, and this superbloom has briars too. All plants are thriving in these conditions, from native wildflowers to invasive weeds.The growth has highlighted truths about our ecosystem that were easier to ignore in drier years: A changing climate has upended bloom schedules, non-native plants have altered the landscape, and many seemingly fallow fields are in fact just beds of dormant life waiting for the right time to bloom.      There's a lot to appreciate about the growth around us. There's a lot to learn from it, too.Even before industrialization and the climate change that resulted from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, rainfall in Southern California varied considerably year to year, Yoder said. As a result, the region's native wildflowers evolved to withstand periods of drought.For a native annual like our state flower, the California poppy, \"their whole life cycle is based on flowering quickly and making seeds and getting those seeds into what we call the seed bank in the soil,\" he said. \"They can hang out there until the next good year,\" which could be next season or the next decade. \"Then they get a good rain and a cold winter to prime them beforehand, and they go crazy.\"In periods of prolonged drought like we've experienced the last few years, many annual plants will allow only a selection of their seeds to flower. It's an evolutionary strategy that lets plants play the long game: A few seeds from the bank are deputized to flower and drop more seeds, while the rest hold off on entering the vulnerable baby plant stage until conditions are more promising.A bumper year like this one is both a visual feast and a down payment on future blooms. Today's wildflowers will make further deposits into the seed bank that can survive in the soil for years until the right conditions come along\u2014provided no one plows them under to build a big-box store or put up a parking lot.\"You can go for a walk and under your feet are millions of seeds just sitting there in the seed bank. That potential for beauty in a landscape that is otherwise essentially barren in a non-good year is so freaking cool,\" said Nick Jensen, director of the conservation program at the California Native Plant Society. \"That is like the coolest thing. It still blows my mind, that that potential is there.\"If you take away nothing else from this season's superbloom, let it be this: Do not confuse a dry brown hillside or field for a lifeless wasteland. It may be a nursery of wildflowers just waiting for the right time to flourish.The inverse is also true. A brilliantly colored hillside doesn't necessarily indicate a thriving, healthy ecosystem at work.The vivid green grass on the foothills, the pops of fuchsia blossoms in thickets of coastal ice plant, the yellow flowers of black mustard: None of it is native to Southern California. A lot of it is also invasive, strong-arming (strong-rooting?) resources away from more beneficial native plants and disrupting the harmony of the ecosystem.This isn't a recent development. Those grasses that turn the hills green after a wet winter were brought here by the Spanish as early as the 18th century to serve as cattle feed. Black mustard arrived around the same time, planted\u2014according to some accounts\u2014along El Camino Real at the order of Spanish missionaries who wanted to highlight their route in gold.\"It's been this 300-year-long process of colonizing this land, from both Native people and native plants,\" said Jason Wise, an environmental educator in Los Angeles.The result is a landscape that may be esthetically pleasing from some angles, but that is fundamentally less resilient in the face of a changing climate.Southern California's indigenous plants have evolved to be more fire-resistant. The Tongva, Tataviam, Chumash and other Native people who originally inhabited this land understood that fact and incorporated it into their land management practices through controlled burns that cleared away excess growth and catalyzed seed release.In contrast, many invasive species ignite easily when an unexpected source of fire is introduced\u2014be it lightning, a cigarette butt or a downed power line\u2014and can quickly escalate into an out-of-control wildfire. Land managers and conservationists are worried that will happen this summer when those thickets of black mustard dry out.\"Whenever the season does turn to drier conditions and that vegetation is no longer as green, it's going to be a bigger fuel supply for burning,\" Yoder said.Multiple things can be true at once. There is a complicated story behind many of this spring's dazzling flowers. Yet they still catch our eye and lift our spirits because they are pretty\u2014and there's a lot to be said for being able to appreciate the beauty in life wherever you happen to find it.Not everyone gets the opportunity to drive out to one of the relatively few areas where wildflowers are protected and observe native plants in all their splendor. There are a lot of places in Southern California where flowering weeds and ornamental shrubbery spilling over the freeway retaining wall are the most accessible plants around. The feeling of joy they evoke still counts.When Wise takes groups of children on nature hikes and they see plants taller than they are, they don't bother to ask if they're invasive before exclaiming with joy. Wise says he tries not to crush that sense of wonder. Instead, he leans into it.\"I'll say, 'Yeah, it's amazing how big these got. All the rain made them huge! Here's where this plant comes from. And do we see what it's doing to the other plants around it? Those ones have some pretty flowers too, but they're kind of in the shade now. What do you think that plant thinks?'\" he said. \"Just providing more things to think about, some extra layers, without just being like, 'No, that's bad, don't like that flower.' That's the nuance of a real-life conversation.\"This season's flowers might leave behind more than the seeds of future blooms. Long after they're gone, they may inspire a renewed desire to protect the land's ability to surprise and delight us the way it has this year. What a legacy that would be.\"The seed bank is a really very, very precious thing, mysterious as it is. All the seeds of all of these gorgeous flowers we see were there, and no one could have told,\" said botanist Lucinda McDade, director of the California Botanic Garden in Claremont. \"Plants are amazing, I'm telling you.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.

    "question_squad": " What is the study of all the RNA molecules in a given tissue at a certain point in time?",
    "text": "An interdisciplinary team in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences\u2014in an initiative aimed at better understanding the implications of climate change for animal and plant life and agricultural systems\u2014is focusing on an emerging field of study called landscape transcriptomics.          In an invited technical review paper recently published in Molecular Ecology Resources, team leader Jason Keagy, assistant research professor of wildlife behavioral ecology, explained that landscape transcriptomics studies how patterns of gene expression in living organisms relate to changes in environment\u2014including habitat, weather, climate and contaminants\u2014as well as the subsequent effects on the function of plants and animals.He explained that a transcriptome is the total of all the RNA molecules expressed from the genes of an organism, essentially a collection of all the gene readouts present in a cell. By looking at finer scale gene expression differences over larger scale environments, trends emerge that offer new insight into how life on Earth is adapting to change, he said.We sat down with Keagy to learn more about the new, complex field.Q: What is landscape transcriptomics?Keagy: Transcriptomics is the study of all the RNA molecules in a given tissue at a certain point in time. Why do we care about RNA? DNA is basically a memory-storage device. For a gene to actually do anything, the letters of DNA must be rewritten as letters of RNA and then translated into a protein.We can literally read the RNA letters to find out which genes are active and how active they are. We can then ask: How is the active part of the DNA code affected by an environmental stressor? That's where the landscape part comes in. Typically, we would do experiments to answer this question. But some things just can't be studied well in the lab. Nature is messy and understanding that messiness is important.So, what if we instead grabbed samples from across the landscape and asked how some variable\u2014temperature, altitude, shade\u2014influenced gene expression, the transcriptome? That, in a nutshell, is landscape transcriptomics.Q: What can researchers accomplish using landscape transcriptomics?Keagy: In the paper we just published, we outline three major areas of research that we envision landscape transcriptomics will address: understanding molecular pathways involved in response to the environment, generating and testing hypotheses about the mechanisms and evolution of these responses to the environment, and applying this knowledge to species conservation and management.The first two are important from the point of view of understanding how organisms respond to the environment, whereas the third is important from a more practical point of view.      Q: What are practical applications of this approach?Keagy: We envision a number of ways landscape transcriptomics can be used for conservation and management. One way is in the development of biomarkers. For example, we could survey brook trout from various streams over a period of time to discover a set of genes that reliably tracks temperature stress. Using this information, we could identify populations that are at risk and target them for habitat or other mitigation.We could also identify populations that are especially resilient to thermal stress and use those for reintroduction or assisted migration. Because gene expression flexibly responds to the environment and because we can often get tissue through non-lethal means\u2014for example, by extracting a tiny piece of gill\u2014it could allow us to much better track population stress.Under a potential future scenario, a technician conducting an electro-fishing survey for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission could take a small piece of gill, put it in a provided vial to preserve it, and mail to Penn State. We would be able to tell the commission whether that fish was exhibiting signs of thermal stress or other stressors for which we had information.Q: Why isn't everyone already using this approach?Keagy: Genomic sequencing is expensive, but it is getting cheaper. We point out in our paper that it is possible to get samples sequenced with certain technologies below $100 per sample. That price will likely continue to come down as there are new generation sequencers coming onto the market.There are also challenges to the approach both from an experimental design and statistical analysis side. We discuss these in the paper and offer some suggestions, although point out that the field could benefit from more work in figuring out the best way to do analysis efficiently.The landscape transcriptomics initiative at Penn State\u2014which includes Christina Grozinger, Publius Vergilius Maro Professor of Entomology; Heather Hines, associate professor of biology and entomology; and Tyler Wagner, assistant unit leader USGS Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and adjunct professor of fisheries ecology\u2014received a Strategic Networks and Initiatives Program Grant Level I from the College of Agricultural Sciences.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the algorithm that allows efficient image-based plant disease detection?",
    "text": "Every year, plant diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi contribute to major economic losses. The prompt detection of these diseases is necessary to curb their spread and mitigate agricultural damage, but represents a major challenge, especially in areas of high-scale production. Smart agriculture systems use camera surveillance equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect features of plant diseases, which often manifest as changes in leaf morphology and appearance.          However, conventional methods of image classification and pattern recognition extract features indicative of diseased plants from a training set. As a result, they have low interpretability, which means it is challenging to describe what features were learned.Further, obtaining large datasets for model training is tedious. Handcrafted features, which are selected based on expert-designed feature detectors, descriptors, and vocabulary, offer a feasible solution to this problem. However, these often result in the adoption of irrelevant features, which reduce algorithm performance.Fortunately, a solution is now on the horizon. A team of data scientists and plant phenomics experts from China and Singapore have developed a swarm intelligence algorithm for feature selection (SSAFS) that allows efficient image-based plant disease detection. They reported the development and validation of this algorithm in their recent study published in Plant Phenomics.Explaining the benefits of introducing SSAFS, the corresponding author of this study, Prof. Zhiwei Ji, comments, \"SSAFS not only significantly reduces the count of features, but also significantly improves the classification accuracy.\"The study used a combination of two principles: high-throughput phenomics, through which plant traits like disease severity can be analyzed on a large scale, and computer vision, in which image features representative of a specific condition are extracted. Using SSAFS and a set of plant images, the researchers identified an \"optimal feature subset\" of plant diseases.This subset encompassed a list of only the high-priority features that could successfully classify a plant as diseased or healthy, and further estimate the severity of disease. The effectiveness of SSAFS was tested in four UCI datasets and six plant phenomics datasets. These datasets were also used to compare the performance of SSAFS to that of five other similar swarm intelligence algorithms.The findings demonstrate that SSAFS performs well in both plant disease detection and severity estimation. Indeed, it outperformed the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in identifying the most valuable handcrafted image features. Interestingly, the majority of these disease-related features were local\u2014i.e., they involved distinct patterns or structures, such as points, edges, and patches, which are often observed in diseased plants.Overall, this algorithm is a valuable tool for obtaining an optimal combination of handcrafted image features indicative of plant diseases. Its adoption could significantly improve plant disease recognition accuracy and reduce the required processing duration.When asked about the future implications of their study, Prof. Ji comments, \"One of the crucial contributions of this work to plant phenomics is the definition of handcrafted features and the precision screen of relevant features through a novel computational approach. We propose to combine comprehensive handcrafted and non-handcrafted features of plant images for accurate and efficient detection in the field of phenomics.\" More information:Zhiwei Ji et al, A novel Feature Selection Strategy Based on Salp Swarm Algorithm for Plant Disease Detection, Plant Phenomics (2023).

It is known to reduce the biodiversity of native ecosystems and to increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires.       A team of researchers recently took a close look at efforts to control buffelgrass in Arizona's Saguaro National Park, located in the Sonoran Desert. An article featured in the journal Invasive Plant Science and Management describes what that investigation can tell us about effective control strategies. After examining data from 2011 to 2020, the team found:Chemical treatments with glyphosate had greater or equal effectiveness as compared to mechanical removal methodsEarly detection and treatment of new areas of buffelgrass invasion can increase treatment effectiveness.Treatments are likely to be more effective if spaced at an interval of less than three years.Steep slopes with south-facing aspects may need more frequent treatment since that environment favors buffelgrass growth.If longer treatment gaps are necessary due to a lack of resources, treatments in areas with less favorable environmental conditions for buffelgrass (e.g., north-facing aspect, low topographic slope) can be cautiously discontinued on a temporary basis.\"Most important of all are long-term monitoring and surveillance,\" says Yue M.

Loonkito, an iconic 19-year-old male lion, was speared to death by Maasai morans (warriors) after straying into a livestock pen in the outskirts of the famed Amboseli National Park, Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) spokesman Paul Jinaro told AFP.\"It was an old lion that had issues... getting prey on its own and livestock is easy prey,\" Jinaro said.\"A normal lion would go for wildlife inside the park.\"African lions typically have a lifespan of up to 18 years in the wild, according to conservation group Cats for Africa.KWS in 2021 described Loonkito as a \"legendary big cat warrior\" who had defended his territory for over a decade.Conservation group Lion Guardians eulogized Loonkito as \"a symbol of resilience and coexistence.\"\"It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of the passing of Loonkito (2004\u20142023), the oldest male lion in our ecosystem and possibly in Africa,\" the non-profit said on Facebook.Causing panicReports of wildlife straying into human habitats in Kenya have increased in recent years as the animals come under growing pressure from cities expanding into ancient migration and hunting grounds.\"People need to be sensitized on looking for a way to alert us and then we can take animals back to the parks,\" KWS official Jinaro said.In July 2021, a lion caused panic after straying from its habitat in Nairobi National Park into a crowded neighborhood during morning rush hour.The park is just seven kilometers (four miles) from the heart of Kenya's capital, and incidents of animals escaping the grassy plains and wandering into the chaotic metropolis of more than four million people are not unheard of.In December 2019, a lion mauled a man to death just outside the park, while in March 2016 another cat was shot dead after attacking and injuring a nearby resident.Just a month before that, in February 2016, two lions spent a day wandering through Kibera, a densely packed city slum, before returning to the park, and days later more lions were spotted in town.There are an estimated 2,500 lions in Kenya, according to the country's first-ever national wildlife census conducted in 2021.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:One of world's oldest lions killed by herders in Kenya (2023, May 12)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-world-oldest-lions-herders-kenya.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "Drugging or \"doping\" thoroughbreds with medications that mask pain and enhance performance\u2014sometimes beyond the breaking point\u2014will no longer be allowed in horse races as of May 22.          The anti-doping regulations are a highlight of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act that marks a new era of federal racing regulation intended to protect race horses from injury and death.But will the measures be enough to restore public confidence in a sport that saw seven thoroughbreds die at Churchill Downs in the lead up to this month's Kentucky Derby?Northeastern Global News spoke to a Northeastern philosophy professor who specializes in applied ethics and an official with the Humane Society of the United States about what it will take for the public to embrace the act's reforms\u2014or whether thoroughbred racing will peter out like dog racing.'Really shocking stuff'\"When people hear of an act like this, it sounds to them like something is being done\" to protect thoroughbred race horses, says Mark Wells, an assistant teaching professor of philosophy at Northeastern.The 2008 race track euthanization of Eight Belles, a filly who broke her two front legs immediately after placing second in the Kentucky Derby, still shocks public consciousness. It is part of a drumroll of animal fatalities that included 42 horse deaths at California's famed Santa Anita race track in 2019.\"Really shocking stuff has happened,\" Wells says.He says the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act can lead to public perception that problems that led to thoroughbred deaths, including the seven who died in the pre-Derby lead up, will be addressed and prevented in the future.It's one way for the industry to attempt to save itself, Wells says.At Santa Anita, officials say steps they took to address thoroughbred safety in the wake of the 2019 tragedy led to a three-fold reduction in horse deaths, with 12 reported for all of 2022.How 'doping' can mask injuriesThe horse racing safety act also addresses the use of whips and safety concerns regarding track surfaces, says Keith Dane, senior director in the equine protection program at the Humane Society of the United States.But it is the anti-doping regulations that seem to hold the greatest potential for preventing horse injuries and deaths, he says.\"Drugs and medications are a major contributor to breakdowns,\" Dane says.Pain-masking drugs hide potential fractures that animals should be allowed to heal from, instead of racing on, he says.Performance enhancing drugs that push thoroughbreds \"beyond their natural limits\" can be another cause of injury, Dane says.Although the horse racing safety act passed in 2020, lawsuits and other legal action stalled the introduction of anti-doping measures, he says.The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the policy-making authority established by the act, ordered the authority to proceed with anti-doping regulations as of May 22, in time for the June 10 Belmont Stakes but too late for this year's other Triple Crown events, the Kentucky Derby on May 6 and the Preakness on May 20.Preventing equine casualties \"is certainly the hope and what we're counting on,\" Dane says.      Will regs be enough?For now, trainers and owners are allowed to put thoroughbreds on Lasix to prevent pulmonary bleeding pending safety studies, Dane says.Lasix, a powerful diuretic, is already banned on race day in Europe, Asia and Australia.Whether anti-doping regulations will be enough to protect thoroughbreds remains to be seen, Wells says.\"Thoroughbreds are built for speed. And if you breed for one particular thing, you get other problems,\" as seen in the case with \"designer\" dogs such as pugs, he says.Weighing about 1,000 pounds on delicate ankles, thoroughbreds are known for being fragile and sensitive even off the race course.\"We're running horses whose bone structures haven't fully developed,\" Wells says. \"This is a dangerous activity we're making these animals do.\"In the sad case of Medina Spirit, stripped of a 2021 Kentucky Derby win after failing a post-race drug test, the colt's death a few months later in December was attributed to a heart attack following a training exercise.Although the thoroughbred's necropsy was incomplete, sampling of hair, urine and blood showed no evidence of doping, according to The New York Times.An industry in declineHorse racing, once the only federally legal form of sports wagering in the U.S., has fallen into decline as other forms of legal sports gambling have taken off.Race tracks have closed around the country. The number of bettors and amounts placed have declined, Dane says.Public perception of horse racing has changed, with some people calling for outright bans on the sport and many others decrying what they see as animal cruelty in long-time practices such as drugging and whipping.In the past, \"people thought of it as a fun outing,\" Dane says. \"If they could make a little money and have fun it was seen as a socially acceptable event. That era has passed. The generations that subscribed to horse racing have aged out.\"But Wells says online horse race betting could actually be a boon for the industry, especially since participants don't have to be physically present at race tracks.\"It totally obscures the reality for the horse when it's just numbers on the page,\" he says.Ban on racing of two-year-olds?PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, has called for further protection of race horses, including racing them only on grass not paved surfaces and prohibiting any kind of competitive racing before the horses turn three.Current races for two-year-olds include the American Pharoah Stakes, which is considered a major stepping stone to the Kentucky Derby. The Derby, like the other Triple Crown races, is composed of 3-year-olds.Whether the public continues to support horse racing \"depends on how well the industry embraces the changes and subscribes to them,\" Dane says.\"We saw what happened with greyhound racing,\" he says. \"That is an industry that is almost non-existent in the United States. An industry that treats the deaths of athletes as the cost of doing business is not going to last forever.\" Provided byNortheastern UniversityCitation:Will new anti-doping regs be enough to save horses\u2014and horse racing?

    "text": "Researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of California San Diego have predicted that the presence of Asian honey bee hornets would harm Apis mellifera colonies more than Apis cerana colonies because of their different exposure to Vespa velutina over evolutionary time. The study was published in Entomologia Generalis.          Collective defense is constrained by co-evolution with the predator. In social insects, such as honey bees, collective defense of the nest is essential. However, the potential cascading effects of predator attack on social insects\u2014directly reducing the number of colony members and, indirectly, stressing the colony to reduce its reproduction\u2014are not well understood.Asian honey bees (Apis species) have co-evolved with predatory Asian hornets (Vespa species) and have evolved several counter-strategies. A. mellifera colonies can respond to attacks by V. velutina hornets by creating a dense \"bee carpet\" consisting of large numbers of bees gathered at the nest entrance. However, this defense is not always effective.In view of this, the researchers measured hornet attacks and honey bee colony fitness proxies (number of eggs, pupae, and workers) in apiaries with both bee species but with and without hornets, and quantified fitness effects across seasons in the presence and absence of hornets.They found that hornet attacks significantly reduced colony fitness of A. mellifera, but not A. cerana. A. mellifera, unlike the native A. cerana, greatly reduced foraging, and experienced higher hornet predation on foragers when attacked by the native V. velutina auraria.They observed that hornet attacks elicited more guarding and stop signals from A. mellifera than from A. cerana. Attacks resulted in reduced queen egg production, fewer pupae, and fewer workers, and colony mortality in A. mellifera. In contrast, hornet attacks did not result in declines in the same proxy measures of colony fitness for A. cerana.\"In addition to direct predation, predator-induced stress may contribute to A. mellifera colony decline. Our results suggest that a largely ineffective defense, such as bee carpet response in A. mellifera, can contribute to population collapse in a social group,\" said Prof. Tan Ken of XTBG.

    "text": "Researchers at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) and colleagues in Japan have developed a specially coated, light-responsive surface that helps test how the direction of gravity impacts cell movements. The findings, published in the journal Science and Technology of Advanced Materials, could lead to a better understanding of what happens to cells in people who are bedridden for prolonged periods and of the impact of gravity's direction on cancer cell migration.          The special surfaces are made by coating glass slides with a combination of molecules that are responsive to light. Shining light on a central, circular area of the slide breaks up the molecules, clearing away a coating-free zone that cells can stick to. Once stabilized in this area, the scientists then use light to clear away an area surrounding the central circle. This encourages the cells to move in an outward direction to fill the square.The team investigated what happens to cell movement when the slide is placed upright, with the cells lying on top and the direction of gravity impacting the cells from top to bottom. They then conducted a similar test with the slide flipped over while supported on either side so that the cells are inverted and the direction of gravity is from the bottom of the cells to their tops.\"We found that the direction of gravity hindered collective cell migration in the inverted position by reducing the number of outward-moving leader cells at cluster edges and by redistributing shape-forming filaments, composed of actin and myosin, so that they kept the cells bundled together,\" explains biomaterials researcher, Shimaa Abdellatef, who is a postdoc at NIMS.The coated, light-responsive surfaces provide an advantage over currently available methods that study the impacts of gravity's direction, as they require physical contact with the surface to which cells are attached. The new approach enables remote induction of cell migration.\"We plan to apply our approach to analyze the responses of cancer cells to the direction of gravity,\" says NIMS nanoscientist, Jun Nakanishi, who led the study. \"We expect to find differences between healthy and diseased cells, which could provide important information about cancer progression in bedridden patients.\" More information:Shinya Sakakibara et al, Photoactivatable surfaces resolve the impact of gravity vector on collective cell migratory characteristics, Science and Technology of Advanced Materials (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is wildlife crime not considered a core policing issue?",
    "text": "Despite being one of the highest value areas of crime globally, with links to organized and violent crime, wildlife crime is falling down the list of policing priorities due to lack of data, resource, and expertise, according to research led by Nottingham Trent University (NTU).          The study, commissioned by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), examines the current state of wildlife crime in the UK and its enforcement. It forms the basis of a major new Make Wildlife Matter report and campaign from IFAW, which aims to galvanize the public, politicians, and organizations to press the government to better protect precious wildlife.Wildlife crime\u2014which increased by an estimated 30% between 2019 and 2021\u2014is broadly defined as the illegal exploitation of wildlife species, including poaching, such as illegal hunting, fishing, killing, or capturing; abuse; and/or trafficking of wild animal species. Interpol and the United Nations Environment Program estimate that natural resources worth as much as USD 91 billion to USD 258 billion annually are being stolen by criminals.Researchers from NTU and the University of Gloucester carried out surveys with police forces and Police and Crime Commissioners in both 2015 and 2022. They also conducted interviews with a range of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and academics with expertise in wildlife crime and wildlife law. In addition, the team analyzed literature on wildlife crime and wildlife law in the UK.Findings showed that wildlife crime is not currently considered a core policing issue and is not given the same priority as 'mainstream' crimes. This is despite 100% of the wildlife crime officers questioned stating that wildlife offending was linked to other forms of serious crime, and 89% saying that wildlife crime should be given the same priority as more traditional types of crime.Wildlife crimes were often seen as being victimless and therefore considered lesser offenses. It is suggested that this lack of a human victim leads to under reporting and a perception of less threat, harm, and risk.In the UK, notifiable offenses are serious crimes that are reported to the Home Office by the Police for statistical purposes, and only a small amount of serious wildlife crimes are notifiable.This was seen as an issue by all of the enforcement officers who completed questionnaires, as it means the lesser status in legislation impacts on the priority afforded to wildlife crime and its recording. This contributes to a lack of clear data on the level of wildlife crimes, as recording is inconsistent and varies by location, making it difficult to identify where priorities should lie.      The research also identifies wildlife crime as an under-resourced area that is heavily reliant on the dedication of individual officers and support from NGOs, such as the RSPB, RSPCA, and the League Against Cruel Sports. Cuts in policing budgets due to austerity measures are also impacting on the effectiveness of wildlife policing.Participants raised concerns about the lack of available expertise in some areas, particularly when prosecutors with expert knowledge and experienced wildlife crime officers move to other roles with no guarantee that the specialist resource will be retained.While the role of wildlife crime officer is recognized as an integral part of the policing response to wildlife crime, participants identified issues with training and the extent to which these officers are able to dedicate themselves to this enforcement given other demands.Dr. Angus Nurse, research lead and Head of Criminology at NTU's School of Social Sciences, said, \"It's clear that enforcement response is variable, indeed our Police and Crime Commissioner respondents indicated a clear belief that some police forces investigate and respond to wildlife crimes better than others.\"Our respondents pointed to some inconsistency in the understanding of wildlife crimes and wildlife and a greater need for training and resources to support effective investigation and prosecution. As a result, we found that effective wildlife crime enforcement is heavily dependent on the enthusiasm, dedication and specialist knowledge of individual officers and prosecutors rather than there being a clear, coordinated, effective permanent system in place across the UK.\"Based on the research findings, the IFAW report calls for a number of changes to policy and law, including making wildlife crimes notifiable; harmonizing, simplifying, and streamlining all UK wildlife law; ensuring that there is at least one dedicated full-time wildlife crime officer per force; incorporating wildlife crime into the Policing Education Qualification Framework; and developing enforcement, prosecution, and sentencing guidelines to combat inconsistencies around wildlife crime scenarios and how those should be dealt with.Frances Goodrum, Head of Campaigns, IFAW UK, said \"Wildlife in the UK is already in crisis\u2014being pushed to the brink through habitat loss, climate change and pollution. But these alarming findings show that criminals are purposefully going out of their way to harm or make profit from them.\"\"The fact that wildlife crime cannot be reported as a crime in a meaningful way means the government cannot measure or manage the current situation. Countless sinister crimes could be being committed\u2014we simply do not know\u2014it is all very 'finger in the air.' This must change\u2014our wildlife deserves better.\" More information:Report: Make Wildlife MatterProvided byNottingham Trent UniversityCitation:Report: Animals at risk as wildlife crime falls down the list of policing priorities (2023, May 12)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-animals-wildlife-crime-falls-policing.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the largest arboreal mammal known from Australia?",
    "text": "Although long dead, fossil skeletons provide an incredible window into the lifestyle and environment of an extinct animal.          By analyzing the various features of fossil bones we can reveal not only the overall size and shape of the animal, but also what kind of movement the animal was capable of, its lifestyle, and the environment in which it lived.But what if we looked inside fossil bones? What secrets would it reveal about the growth and development of an extinct animal? In a newly published paper in the Journal of Paleontology, we have done just that, using 15 million-year-old skeletons of a giant bear-like marsupial from the world-famous Riversleigh World Heritage Area (Boodjamulla) in Waanyi country of northwest Queensland.Tree-dwelling wombat relatives The huge tree-dwelling herbivorous marsupials, known as Nimbadon, weighed about 70kg, making them the largest arboreal (tree dwelling) mammals known from Australia.Nimbadon belongs to a diverse group of long extinct, large-bodied marsupials known as diprotodontoids, the likes of which include the largest marsupial to have ever lived, the 2.5 ton megafaunal Diprotodon, and bizarre trunked marsupials reminiscent of modern-day tapirs.Among living animals, Nimbadon is most closely related to wombats. Yet surprisingly, in terms of body size and lifestyle, they are more comparable to sun bears, which today can be found scaling the rainforest canopies of Southeast Asia.                Modern-day sun bears climb trees and lounge there much like sloths do. Credit: Shutterstock When we first uncovered jawbones of Nimbadon at Riversleigh in 1993, we thought we were looking at very large leaf-eating marsupials who foraged for food on the forest floor.But like many of the species we've unearthed from Riversleigh, the closer we look at these animals, the more bizarre and fascinating they become.Nimbadon is now known from its complete skeleton, including material representing developmental ages ranging from tiny pouch-young to mature adults. It had strong arms with very mobile shoulder and elbow joints. Its hands and feet had specially adapted opposable thumbs with huge curved claws for climbing, penetrating bark and grasping branches.These animals were highly specialized climbers and lived vastly different lifestyles compared to their closest living relatives\u2014the land-dwelling, burrowing wombats.Our initial research showed that Nimbadon was not only a \"tree-hugger,\" but also a \"tree-hanger,\" spending some of its time suspended from tree branches like a sloth.                Fossil skeleton of a mature adult Nimbadon. Credit: Karen Black, Author provided             Nimbadon lived 15 million years ago in the canopy of lowland Australian rainforests. These biodiverse, lush forests were home to some equally strange animals: flesh-eating kangaroos, tree-climbing crocodiles, ancestral thylacines, cat- to leopard-sized marsupial lions, huge anaconda-like snakes, giant toothed platypuses and mysterious marsupials so strange they have been called \"Thingodonta.\" It was a very different Australia than the one we see today.      Sectioning the bones Despite the wealth of information we have gleaned from Nimbadon skeletons, until now we hadn't fully understood the growth patterns of these ancient marsupials.Were they affected by seasonality? How long did they take to grow to adult body size in the canopies of the ancient forest? Clues to these questions lay in the bones' microscopic structure.To look inside the fossil bones, we needed to select the right material. Long bones, such as the bones of the leg, are known to preserve a good record of growth, so we analyzed ten long bones of several different-sized individuals.                Articulated fossilized Nimbadon skeletons in a large slab of limestone recovered from a 15 million year old fossil cave deposit in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland. Credit: Anna Gillespie, Author provided             We began by removing a section from the shaft of the bone, and embedded it in resin. Using a diamond-edged blade, we cut our samples into thin sections and polished them further until light could pass through them. These thinned sections were mounted on glass microscope slides to be studied.Remarkably, even after millions of years of fossilization, the microscopic structure of the fossil bones had remained intact. We were amazed to discover that Nimbadon grew in periodic spurts. Individuals had fast growth periods, each followed by a slow growth period, often associated with a band of arrested growth.Seasonal growers Cyclical growth patterns have previously been documented for marsupials such as in the living western gray kangaroo. However, our results indicate that, overall, the limbs of Nimbadon had a much slower, more extenuated growth than kangaroo limbs.One individual recorded at least seven to eight growth cycles, which suggests this arboreal giant needed at least this amount of time\u2014and probably more\u2014to become a fully-grown, sexually mature adult.Based on these alternating cycles of fast and slow growth, Nimbadon may have been affected by seasonal conditions such as food availability. However, exactly how long it took for eight growth cycles to develop remains a mystery. If indeed they represent annual cycles, it would be at least eight years until sexual maturity, which is unusual in the modern marsupial world.For example, kangaroos are sexually mature at one to two years. That being said, Nimbadon is an unusual beast and a very large one at that, so an extended developmental period (and lifespan) is not unlikely.Real-life drop bears We have come to think about these strange arboreal marsupials as real versions of the legendary \"drop bears\" of Australian folklore\u2014mysterious tree-dwelling creatures that would drop down on unsuspecting animals below.While moving in herds through the rainforest canopy, both young and adult Nimbadon would have occasionally lost their grip before dropping down from the treetops. Sometimes they would end up in forest floor caves, which is where we have been finding their still-articulated skeletons.Given the constant surprises that research into this extraordinary, extinct Riversleigh mammal has already produced, we are eager and prepared for still more.Currently we are looking into wear in the enamel microstructure of Nimbadon's teeth to determine this legendary drop bear's diet. We expect that what we find down the track will continue to upend our na\u00efve first presumptions about the lifestyles of this and many of the other strange inhabitants of the ancient inland rainforests of Riversleigh.

    "question_squad": " What is the term for the bits and pieces of RNA and protein within a cell?",
    "text": "Organelles\u2014the bits and pieces of RNA and protein within a cell\u2014play important roles in human health and disease, such as maintaining homeostasis, regulating growth and aging, and generating energy. Organelle diversity in cells not only exists between cell types but also individual cells. Studying these differences helps researchers better understand cell function, leading to improved therapeutics to treat various diseases.          In two papers out of the lab of Ahmet F. Coskun, a Bernie Marcus Early Career professor in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, researchers examined a specific type of stem cell with an intracellular toolkit to determine which cells are most likely to create effective cell therapies.\"We are studying the placement of organelles within cells and how they communicate to help better treat disease,\" said Coskun. \"Our recent work proposes the use of an intracellular toolkit to map organelle bio-geography in stem cells that could lead to more precise therapies.\"Creating the subcellular omics toolkitThe first study\u2014published in Scientific Reports\u2014looked at mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have historically offered promising treatments for repairing defective cells or modulating the immune response in patients. In a series of experiments, the researchers were able to create a data-driven, single-cell approach through rapid subcellular proteomic imaging that enabled personalized stem cell therapeutics.The researchers then implemented a rapid multiplexed immunofluorescence technique in which they used antibodies designed to target specific organelles. By fluorescing antibodies, they tracked wavelengths and signals to compile images of many different cells, creating maps. These maps then enabled researchers to see the spatial organization of organelle contacts and geographical spread in similar cells to determine which cell types would best treat various diseases.\"Usually, the stem cells are used to repair defective cells or treat immune diseases, but our micro-study of these specific cells showed just how different they can be from one another,\" said Coskun. \"This proved that patient treatment population and customized isolation of the stem cells identities and their bioenergetic organelle function should be considered when selecting the tissue source. In other words, in treating a specific disease, it might be better to harvest the same type of cell from different locations depending on the patient's needs.\"      RNA-RNA proximity matters In the next study, published this week in Cell Reports Methods, the researchers took the toolkit a step further, studying the spatial organization of multiple neighboring RNA molecules in single cells, which are important to cellular function. The researchers evolved the tool by combining machine learning and spatial transcriptomics. They found that analyzing the variations of gene proximity for classification of cell types was more accurate that analyzing gene expression only.\"The physical interactions between molecules create life; therefore, the physical locations and proximity of these molecules play important roles,\" said Coskun. \"We created an intracellular toolkit of subcellular gene neighborhood networks in each cell's different geographical parts to take a closer look at this.\"The experiment consisted of two parts: the development of computational methods and experiments at the lab bench. The researchers examined published datasets and an algorithm to group RNA molecules based on their physical location. This \"nearest neighbor\" algorithm helped determine gene groupings. On the bench, researchers then labeled RNA molecules with fluorescents to easily locate them in single cells. They then uncovered many features from the distribution of RNA molecules, such as how genes are likely to be in similar subcellular locations.Cell therapy requires many cells with highly similar phenotypes, and if there are subtypes of unknown cells in therapeutic cells, researchers cannot predict the behavior of these cells once injected into patients. With these tools, more cells of the same type can be identified, and distinct stem cell subsets with uncommon gene programs can be isolated.\"We are expanding the toolkit for the subcellular spatial organization of molecules\u2014a 'Swiss Army Knife' for the subcellular spatial omics field, if you will,\" said Coskun. \"The goal is to measure, quantify, and model multiple independent but also interrelated molecular events in each cell with multiple functionalities. The end purpose is to define a cell's function that can achieve high energy, Lego-like modular gene neighborhood networks and diverse cellular decisions.\" More information:Mythreye Venkatesan et al, Spatial subcellular organelle networks in single cells, Scientific Reports (2023).

    "text": "A pair of evolutionary ecologists from Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, working with a colleague from the New York Institute of Technology, reports that differential species proliferation was likely the key to the evolutionary increase in size of brontotheres. In their study, reported in the journal Science, Oscar Sanisidro, Juan Cantalapiedra and Matthew Mihlbachler studied the fossil record of the huge beasts and created computer simulations to show how they likely evolved.          In the late 1800s, zoologist Edward Drinker Cope developed a rule to describe the means by which animals evolve to grow larger in size, as many advantages tend to accrue to larger species. That rule, now known as Cope's rule, appears to apply to a large number of species, but sometimes, other factors may come into play that skirt the rule, promoting growth for other reasons. In this new effort, the researchers found that another factor was likely at play with the evolution of brontotheres\u2014a family of extinct mammals that were known for their huge size, at least some of them. And that difference convinced the researchers that Cope's rule did not apply.Prior to the Chicxulub impact, dinosaurs were the only large land-dwelling animals. After their demise, mammals began filling their niche, with brontotheres leading the way. Over just 16 million years, some grew from dog-sized creatures to rhinoceros-looking behemoths weighing more than a metric ton. In this new effort, Sanisidro, Cantalapiedra and Mihlbachler sought to learn more about the factors that allowed them to grow so quickly.The researchers studied 276 brontothere fossils and created simulations based on their findings. They assumed that brontothere growth followed one of three scenarios\u2014one followed Cope's rule, another cited adjustments to changing adaptive zones, and the third possibility was that some sort of speciational evolution had occurred without preferential direction.After looking at their models and data, the researchers came to believe the most likely option was the third. They cite evidence showing that as time passed, some species of brontotheres grew smaller, some stayed about the same size and some grew larger. As more time passed, the larger species found more success and continued to get bigger, right up to the end of the Eocene epoch, when they went extinct, likely because of a changing climate.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the fungi that can cause serious infections?",
    "text": "The bacteria present in the intestine provide information about the quantities of fungi of the potentially disease-causing Candida genus. Among them, and surprisingly, are lactic acid bacteria that are known for their protective effect against fungal infections. The findings of researchers at the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology (Leibniz-HKI) and their collaborative partners from Denmark and Hungary add another piece to the puzzle of understanding the human gut microbiome.          The human gut microbiome is an extremely complex community in which different microorganisms keep each other in check. However, if an imbalance occurs due to antibiotics or other environmental influences, individual species can spread and lead to infection. Fungi of the Candida genus, for example, are present in the intestines of many healthy people. They are usually harmless, but can also cause dangerous systemic infections.Studying these interactions in the intestine is difficult. The several hundred species of bacteria and fungi can only be partially cultivated in the laboratory, and many are not even known. Researchers at the Leibniz-HKI are therefore trying to shed more light on the intestine using metagenome studies.For the study now published in Nature Communications, the researchers examined stool samples from 75 cancer patients and found that certain bacterial species always appear in greater numbers when the amount of fungi from the Candida genus is also high. \"With these data, we developed a computer model that was able to predict the amount of Candida in another group of patients with an accuracy of about 80% based on bacterial species and amounts alone,\" explains Bastian Seelbinder, lead author of the study. These bacteria included mainly oxygen-tolerant species.A surprising findSeelbinder conducts research in Gianni Panagiotou's Microbiome Dynamics department at Leibniz-HKI, which focuses intensively on the gut microbiome. What surprised the researchers was not only how successful the prediction of the amount of fungi based on the bacterial species present was, but also which bacteria correlated with high amounts of fungi. \"We found an increased number of bacterial species that produce lactic acid, including Lactobacillus species,\" Seelbinder explains. It's a finding he had not expected. \"I could hardly believe it at first, so I checked several times, always with the same result.\"The reason for his surprise: Several studies have attested to the protective effect of lactic acid bacteria against fungal infections. One of them was published last year by Panagiotou's group, also in the journal Nature Communications. \"The result shows once again how complex the human gut microbiome is and how difficult it is to decipher the interactions of different microorganisms,\" Panagiotou says.The researchers' hunch: Lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genus Lactobacillus, favor Candida proliferation but at the same time make the fungus less virulent. This could be due to the fact that Candida species can switch their metabolism to be able to use the lactate produced by lactic acid bacteria. This gives them a competitive advantage over other fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as the researchers discovered in additional experiments. However, the metabolic switch also apparently causes Candida to remain in its usually harmless spherical yeast form instead of forming fungal hyphae that could invade the intestinal mucosa.Strategies for high-risk patients\"There is also a suggestion that certain groups of Lactobacillus species might have different effects,\" Seelbinder says. To investigate this, the next step will be to perform more detailed genomic analyses of the bacteria.\"For the current study, we examined stool samples from cancer patients who are particularly at risk for fungal infections,\" Panagiotou explains. For further studies, samples from healthy subjects could be included to develop long-term strategies for at-risk patients based on their microbiome.For their studies, the Leibniz-HKI researchers cooperated with teams from the Kor\u00e1nyi National Institute of Pulmonology in Hungary, the Technical University of Denmark and Jena University Hospital, among others.

A new study titled \"Nanotopography modulates intracellular excitable systems through cytoskeleton actuation,\" published May 1, 2023, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a University of Maryland-led Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) has opened the door to seeing how cells react to physical signals.\"We elucidated a cell's sense of touch,\" said Wolfgang Losert, a professor of physics at UMD and a team leader of the study. \"We think how cells sense the physical environment may be quite distinct from how they sense the chemical environment. This may help us develop new treatment options for conditions that involve altered physical cellular environments, such as tumors, immune disease and wound healing.\"A major difference between chemical and physical signals is size. Chemical signals are 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Physical cues are the heavyweights in the ring.\"We looked at how cells sense crucial physical cues from their environment that are on the order of 100 times larger than chemical signaling molecules,\" said Losert, who also has a joint appointment in UMD's Institute for Physical Science and Technology (IPST).\"We're really answering a kind of long-standing mystery of how cells react to cues in their environment that are on a physical rather than chemical-size scale,\" said paper co-author and MURI team member John T. Fourkas, a professor in UMD's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry with a joint appointment in IPST.The MURI team studied the major players in a cell's interaction with its physical environment: the cytoskeleton, a network of proteins that surround a cell and acts as a direct sensor of the physical environment; actin, the protein that keeps cells connected; and the cell's signaling pathways.Qixin Yang (Ph.D. '22, physics), who led the experiments and analysis for her Ph.D. research at UMD, said, \"I think our work related to the cytoskeleton shows that it plays an important role in sensing physical cues, like pain.\"The MURI team found that the networks that guide cell migration are upstream for chemical sensing and downstream for physical, topographic sensing; and that actin is the direct sensor for both types of signals.\"I think this is the first real crucial confirmation that actin itself is the sensor and that the waves are really where they are in the sensing pathway, not way downstream, but up front and center,\" Fourkas said.\"Our findings reveal that, in much the same way that patterns of waves in the ocean allow an expert surfer to understand the undersea topography, the so-called 'mechano-chemical' waves in cells are key in sensing signals from their physical environment that are much larger than single proteins,\" Losert said. \"That has implications for how you might design physical interventions to change the behavior of cells.\"For instance, previous research by a co-author of this study, Peter Devreotes of Johns Hopkins University, found that actin dynamics were different for cancer cells considered most invasive.\"Understanding how drugs impact waves is an important additional piece of information that may be used in making decisions on treatment options,\" Losert said. \"I see our study also providing pointers on how you can improve the ability of immune cells to be guided to their target.\" More information:Qixin Yang et al, Nanotopography modulates intracellular excitable systems through cytoskeleton actuation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

    "text": "In a study published today in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, an international research team led by scientists from the University of T\u00fcbingen and the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Paleoenvironment presents the earliest human footprints known from Germany. The tracks were discovered in the roughly 300,000-year-old Sch\u00f6ningen Paleolithic site complex in Lower Saxony. The footprints, presumably from Homo heidelbergensis, are surrounded by several animal tracks\u2014collectively, they present a picture of the ecosystem at that time.          In an open birch and pine forest with an understory of grasses sits a lake, a few kilometers long and several hundred meters wide. On its muddy shores, herds of elephants, rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates gather to drink or bathe. In the midst of this scenery stands a small family of \"Heidelberg people,\" a species of human long since extinct.\"This is what it might have looked like at Sch\u00f6ningen in Lower Saxony 300,000 years ago,\" explains the lead author of the newly published study, Dr. Flavio Altamura, a fellow at the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of T\u00fcbingen (SHEP). \"For the first time, we conducted a detailed investigation of the fossil footprints from two sites in Sch\u00f6ningen.\"These tracks, together with information from sedimentological, archaeological, paleontological, and paleobotanical analyses, provide us with insights into the paleoenvironment and the mammals that once lived in this area. Among the prints are three tracks that match hominin footprints\u2014with an age of about 300,000 years, they are the oldest human tracks known from Germany and were most likely left by Homo heidelbergensis.\"                Fossil footprints from the site Sch\u00f6ningen 13 II-2 Untere Berme. Credit: University of T\u00fcbingen             The scientists attribute two of the three human tracks at Sch\u00f6ningen to young individuals who used the lake and its resources in a small mixed-age group. \"Depending on the season, plants, fruits, leaves, shoots, and mushrooms were available around the lake. Our findings confirm that the extinct human species dwelled on lake or river shores with shallow water. This is also known from other Lower and Middle Pleistocene sites with hominin footprints,\" says Altamura.The various tracks at Sch\u00f6ningen offer a snapshot of a family's daily life and may provide information about the behavior and social composition of hominin groups as well as spatial interactions and coexistence with elephant herds and other, smaller mammals, according to the study. \"Based on the tracks, including those of children and juveniles, this was probably a family outing rather than a group of adult hunters,\" says the archaeologist and expert on fossil footprints.In addition to the human tracks, the team analyzed a series of elephant tracks attributable to the extinct species Palaeoloxodon antiquus\u2014an elephant with straight tusks that was the largest land animal at the time and whose adult bulls reached a body weight of up to 13 tons.\"The elephant tracks we discovered at Sch\u00f6ningen reach an impressive length of 55 centimeters. In some cases, we also found wood fragments in the prints that were pushed into the\u2014at that time still soft\u2014soil by the animals,\" explains Dr. Jordi Serangeli, excavation supervisor at Sch\u00f6ningen. \"There is also one track from a rhinoceros\u2014Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis or Stephanorhinus hemitoechus\u2014which is the first footprint of either of these Pleistocene species ever found in Europe.\" More information:Flavio Altamura et al, Fossil footprints at the late lower Paleolithic site of Sch\u00f6ningen (Germany): A new line of research to reconstruct animal and hominin paleoecology, Quaternary Science Reviews (2023).

    "text": "People who follow the Mediterranean diet\u2014rich in fats from olive oil and nuts\u2014tend to live longer, healthier lives than others who chow down primarily on fast food, meat and dairy. But it hasn't been clear on a cellular level exactly why the diet is so beneficial.          Now researchers led by the Stanford School of Medicine have found one of the first cellular connections between healthy fats\u2014known as monounsaturated fatty acids\u2014and lifespan in laboratory worms. The finding hints at a complex relationship between diet, fats and longevity.\"Fats are generally thought to be detrimental to health,\" said professor of genetics Anne Brunet, Ph.D. \"But some studies have shown that specific types of fats, or lipids, can be beneficial.\"The researchers learned that one of the fats in the Mediterranean diet, oleic acid, increases the number of two key cellular structures, or organelles, and protects cellular membranes from damage by a chemical reaction called oxidation. This protective effect has a big payoff: Worms fed food rich in oleic acid lived about 35% longer than those consigned to standard worm rations, the researchers found.Surprisingly, one of the organelles, known as lipid droplets, served as a de facto crystal ball, predicting with increasing accuracy the number of days each animal would live.\"The number of lipid droplets in individual worms tells me that animal's remaining lifespan,\" said research scientist Katharina Papsdorf, Ph.D. \"The worms with greater numbers of lipid droplets live longer than those with fewer droplets.\"Brunet, who is the school's Michele and Timothy Barakett Professor of Genetics, is the senior author of the study, which was published May 1 in Nature Cell Biology. Papsdorf is the lead author of the research.\"For years, we've been very interested in learning how diet influences lifespan,\" Brunet said. \"It will be fascinating to see whether we see a similar association between lipid droplets and longevity in mammals and humans. These findings suggest there may be a fat-based strategy to improve human health and longevity.\"A fat by (many) other namesAnyone who has struggled to remember the difference between \"good cholesterol\" and \"bad cholesterol\" and how to cultivate one over the other will know that the language of fats can be confusing. In general, most monounsaturated fats, which are found in plant-based foods like avocados, olive oil and nuts, are considered relatively healthy. Saturated fats and trans fats\u2014those that are solid at room temperature\u2014can increase the risk of heart disease and other health complications. Fats and oils are made up of fatty acids; lipids include fats, oils, fatty acids and cholesterol.Papsdorf and her colleagues used a tiny roundworm called C. elegans in their studies of longevity. The worms, which are about 1 millimeter long, normally live about 18 to 20 days. In the wild, they live in soil and feed on bacteria found on decaying plant matter. In the laboratory, they cruise in lazy arcs across the surface of specially prepared laboratory dishes peppered with bacteria. C. elegans reproduce quickly, are inexpensive and easy to keep, and their genomes and neural networks have been completely mapped, making them a good model for studying aging and disease.\"The worms allowed us to track molecular changes that occur with changes in diet, and to determine which of these changes affect lifespan,\" Papsdorf said.Papsdorf and her colleagues compared the effect of feeding the worms bacteria grown on laboratory dishes supplemented with oleic acid versus a structurally similar compound called elaidic acid. Elaidic acid is a monounsaturated trans fatty acid (trans fats = bad!) found in margarine and dairy products and is known to be unhealthy in humans. It is missing a kink in its molecule structure that is present in oleic acid.\"We saw that the numbers of lipid droplets in the worms' intestinal cells increased if the worms were exposed to oleic acid, and that this correlated with an extension of lifespan,\" Brunet said. \"In contrast, exposure to elaidic acid didn't increase the number of lipid droplets and had no effect on longevity.\"Lipid droplets are reservoirs in which cells store fats. They play a central role in cellular metabolism\u2014regulating when, where and whether the fats are used as energy for the cell. The accumulation of the droplets was critical to oleic acid's effect; blocking genes for droplet-making proteins reduced the animals' lifespans to normal.In addition to tracking the numbers of lipid droplets, the researchers noted an increase in the number of peroxisomes in the intestinal tissue of worms exposed to oleic acid. Peroxisomes contain enzymes involved in metabolism and oxidation.The numbers of lipid droplets and peroxisomes are higher in younger animals and naturally decrease with age, suggesting that they are co-regulated in some manner. They can also vary among individuals. Papsdorf found that among young worms fed a normal diet, those with greater numbers of lipid droplets lived a slightly, but statistically significant, longer duration than genetically identical animals of the same age with fewer droplets. The effect was more pronounced among older animals; middle-aged worms with more lipid droplets lived an average of 33% longer than their genetically identical peers.\"Interestingly, calorie restriction has also been associated with longevity in animals and humans,\" Brunet said. \"But studies have shown that, among calorie-restricted mice, it is often the fattest individuals that live the longest. This suggests fat has a dual aspect. Some aspects are very negative, but other aspects can be positive.\"      Avoiding 'lipid oxidation'Finally, the researchers showed that oleic acid supplementation reduced a chemical reaction called lipid oxidation, which damages cellular membranes. In contrast, elaidic acid increased lipid oxidation. \"Membrane oxidation is very bad news for an organism,\" Brunet said. \"Cell membranes can begin to leak and fail, which can cause a cascade of adverse biological effects.\"The researchers' findings are the first to suggest that lipid droplets and peroxisomes are co-regulated through a biological pathway responsive to the presence of beneficial monounsaturated fatty acids, and that aging might be staved off by protecting cellular membranes from oxidation.\"There is still a lot of research to be done to learn whether and how these findings apply to humans,\" Brunet said. \"Often when one sees lipid droplets in mammalian tissue it is an indication of obesity and other health problems. But it's possible that droplets of a certain size, or shape, or in a specific tissue have varying health impacts. We need to understand what distinguishes them in the context of disease and longevity.\" More information:Katharina Papsdorf et al, Lipid droplets and peroxisomes are co-regulated to drive lifespan extension in response to mono-unsaturated fatty acids, Nature Cell Biology (2023).

    "text": "New University of Colorado Boulder research shows the number of farms globally will shrink in half as the size of the average existing farms doubles by the end of the 21st century, posing significant risks to the world's food systems.          Published May 11 in the journal Nature Sustainability, the study is the first to track the number and size of farms year-over-year, from the 1960s and projecting through 2100.The study shows that even rural, farm-dependent communities in Africa and Asia will experience a drop in the number of operating farms.\"We see a turning point from widespread farm creation to widespread consolidation on a global level, and that's the future trajectory that humanity is currently on,\" said Zia Mehrabi, assistant professor of environmental studies at CU Boulder. \"The size of the farm and the number of farms that exist are associated with key environmental and social outcomes.\"To evaluate the global state of farming, Mehrabi used data from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization on agricultural area, GDP per capita and rural population size of more than 180 countries to first reconstruct the evolution of farm numbers from 1969\u20132013 and then to project those numbers through 2100.His analysis found that the number of farms around the world would drop from 616 million in 2020 to 272 million in 2100. A key reason: As a country's economy grows, more people migrate to urban areas, leaving fewer people in rural areas to tend the land.Reap what you sowA decline in the number of farms and an increase in farm size has been happening in the United States and Western Europe for decades. The most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicates there were 200,000 fewer farms in 2022 than in 2007.Mehrabi's analysis found that a turning point from farm creation to widespread consolidation will begin to occur as early as 2050 in communities across Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa will follow the same course later in the century, the research found.It also shows that even if the total amount of farmland doesn't change across the globe in coming years, fewer people will own and farm what land there is available. The trend could threaten biodiversity in a time where biodiversity conservation is top of mind.\"Larger farms typically have less biodiversity and more monocultures,\" Mehrabi said. \"Smaller farms typically have more biodiversity and crop diversity, which makes them more resilient to pest outbreaks and climate shocks.\"And it's not just biodiversity: Food supply is also at risk. Mehrabi's previous research shows the world's smallest farms make up just 25% of the world's agricultural land but harvest one-third of the world's food.Moreover, fewer farms mean fewer farmers who may carry with them valuable Indigenous knowledge dating back centuries. As farms consolidate, that knowledge is replaced by new technology and mechanization.      Building a diverse food portfolioJust as a diverse investment portfolio performs better than one that is not diversified, having diversity in the world's food source portfolio is beneficial in the long run, said Mehrabi.\"If you're investing in today's food systems with around 600 million farms in the world, your portfolio is pretty diverse,\" Mehrabi said. \"If there's damage to one farm, it's likely the impact to your portfolio will be averaged out with the success of another. But if you decrease the number of farms and increase their size, the effect of that shock on your portfolio is going to increase. You're carrying more risk.\"There are also upsides to the shift in corporate farm ownership: The paper points out that consolidation in farming can lead to improved labor productivity and economic growth with a larger workforce in non-farm employment and improved management systems.One of the biggest benefits of farm consolidation, Mehrabi said, is improved economic opportunity for people, and the ability to choose their own career path within our outside of the agricultural sector.But those future farm workers may need more support as suicide rates in the agriculture industry are among the highest rates by occupation in the U.S.\"Currently, we have around 600 million farms feeding the world, and they're carrying 8 billion people on their shoulders,\" Mehrabi said. \"By the end of the century, we'll likely have half the number of farmers feeding even more people. We really need to think about how we can have the education and support systems in place to support those farmers.\"By raising awareness of global agricultural trends, Mehrabi hopes his analysis will lead to policies that ensure biodiversity conservation, maintain climate resilience, preserve Indigenous knowledge and provide incentives to improve the rural economy in countries around the world.

    "text": "Visitors to Belgium's coast are having to get used to North Sea visitors not seen for a while\u2014dozens of seals that are using the short sandy coastline as a resting place.          The reason? During the long period of COVID restrictions between early 2020 and early 2022, the sea mammals found the sandy stretches to be calm, without the usual crowds of people.Now with people returning, and ahead of what could be a bumper summer season, the challenge for Belgian animal protection groups is to educate the public on how to coexist with dozens of seals getting some downtime.The exact number of the seals using the coast is hard to pin down but is probably between 100 and 200, according to Kelle Moreau, a marine biologist who is spokesman for the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences.The two species that waddle up here are gray seals, whose adults can weigh 300 kilograms (660 pounds), and common or harbor seals, a smaller mammal that weighs up to 165 kilograms.The beaches, though, are essential for seal pups, which hang back in relative safety on land until they get hungry enough that instinct pushes them to go into the sea to find food.That is why, Moreau explained, it is vital that humans do not feed them.\"At the start of the lives, the pups have to spend a few days on the beach until they get hungry. If someone feeds them, they won't go into the sea and learn how to hunt,\" he said.To keep beachgoers at bay, volunteers rope off areas that seals are using.In one spot near Belgium's main coastal town of Ostend, a dozen people stand behind a rope fascinated by two seals on the sand.Around these zones, volunteers with the North Seal Team wearing orange fluorescent vests tell people that dogs have to be kept on a leash.                Beach areas with seals are roped off, to keep people at a safe distance.             \"We take turns all day long, from seven in the morning to 10 or 11 at night,\" Inge de Bruycker, founder of the group, tells AFP in between calling out to curious passers-by to be less noisy.The seals \"need to be left alone because they get very stressed very quickly.\"And when you go near them, if they go swimming again they can drown. If they are tired, they can drown.\"Keeping dogs away is important, she said, because \"seals have bitten some dogs, and dogs have bitten some seals\"\"We don't want that happening to people, especially not to children.\"      Injured sealsNorth Seal Team, created soon after COVID restrictions were imposed in Belgium, worked with Ostend municipal authorities to devise rules for behavior around beached seals, notably on giving the animals 30 meters (yards) of safe distance.For the seagoing mammals, the return of people to coastline they had thought deserted is an adjustment.\"The seals became used to coming to rest up on the beaches and people are generally happy when they see them. They want to pet them, take selfies with them,\" said Moreau, who works for the Belgium natural sciences institute.Some people have mistakenly thought the seals were inadvertently beached and tried to push them back into the sea. \"But these are wild animals!\" he said.In some cases, however, the seals do need direct human care.                Fishing nets are a hazard for seals.             That is the role of the Seal Rehabilitation Center.It is located in the Sea Life Blankenberge aquarium, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Ostend.North Seal Team volunteers contact it through WhatsApp groups when they come across a seal that might need attention.Increasing numbers of people walking the beaches also get in touch.\"They send us images of the animal and we decide if we need to step in or not,\" said Steve Vermote, head of Sea Life Blanenberge.\"We are actually having more interventions because some seals are perfectly fine to actually survive in the wild and they might have a minor wound, but we see seals with bigger wounds these days.\"Most of the treated animals are released after two months. But some, like a blind female named Lily, are taken in indefinitely.Last year, the center treated a dozen gray seals and three harbor seals.It also gave care to several seals with neck wounds, probably caused by a type of fixed fishing net that is not easy for them to spot.The Royal Institute of Natural Sciences says those types of nets were the cause of dozens of seal deaths in 2021, which led to Belgium banning them for recreational fishing.Last year, the remains of 54 seals were counted on Belgian beaches, according to the institute, noting that that was half the number from 2021.For Moreau, that is an indication that the new ban is working, and that humans and seals are able to find ways to coexist.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Belgium learns to share its beaches with sleepy seals (2023, May 12)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-belgium-beaches-sleepy.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the term for the collection of chemical changes to DNA that modify gene expression?",
    "text": "Have you ever wondered why some people might get sicker than others, even when they catch the same virus? It is not yet clear why this is. Viral factors (such as differences in the strain of a virus) play a role in this variability, but they cannot account for the wide range of responses in different individuals infected by the same virus. A number of host factors have also been considered, including pre-existing immunity, age, sex, weight, and the microbiome.          Another important factor is the molecular biology within your cells. DNA is shown as one long double-helical strand. So, you might expect that the cell would always read genetic information in order, starting at one end and going to the other. But this isn't the case. DNA contains transposable elements, sometimes called \"junk DNA,\" which can change the regions of the genome are being read at a given time.A new work published in Cell Genomics by an international team led by Dr. Guillaume Bourque studied the role of these transposable elements on the severity of illness after influenza A virus infection.By examining data from 39 individuals before and after infection with influenza A virus, the researchers were able to identify changes in the accessibility (that is, the \"readability\") of transposable elements. To do this, the researchers used an approach combining various sets of multiomics data, which characterize and quantify collections of biomolecules in cells or organisms.One was the transcriptome, which consists of all copies of RNA transcribed from DNA in the cell. The other was the epigenome, which is the collection of chemical changes to DNA that modify gene expression. An advantage of this multiomics approach is that they were able to identify families of transposable elements with changes in accessibility, which would have likely been missed by previous approaches.By considering these changes in transposable elements after viral infection, they could identify several transcription factors (proteins that turn specific genes \"on\" or \"off\") that likely contribute to someone's response to infection. Using these findings, the researchers were able to create a model that could predict an individual's viral load after influenza A infection.\"A number of questions remain, such as whether the link between transposable elements and viral load is actually causal and whether these changes would be consistent over time,\" says lead author Xun Chen. \"But these findings are an important step toward understanding the role that such factors play in the variability of illness severity among individuals.\" More information:Xun Chen et al, Transposable elements are associated with the variable response to influenza infection, Cell Genomics (2023).

    "text": "Exceptionally well-preserved fossils from the Cambrian period have helped fill a gap in our understanding of the origin and evolution of major animal groups alive today.          A new analysis of fossils belonging to an extinct invertebrate called Rotadiscus grandis have helped place this species in the animal tree of life, revealing how some characteristics of living species may have evolved independently rather than originating in a single common ancestor.Half a billion years ago, an unusual-looking animal crawled over the sea floor, using tentacles to pick up food particles along the way.Known as Rotadiscus grandis, this animal lived during the Cambrian period when a burst of evolutionary activity is thought to have given rise to many of the major animal groups we see today.The ancient remains of Rotadiscus were first discovered over 30 years ago, but the incomplete specimens made it challenging to determine their evolutionary significance.Now, a new study published in Current Biology describes Rotadiscus grandis in far more detail after rare, exceptionally preserved fossils were unearthed from the Chengjiang biota in Yunnan Province in China. The 518-million-year-old fossils have shone a new light on the evolution of early members of major animal groups.Dr. Imran Rahman, a principal researcher at the Museum and lead author of the study, says, \"Rotadiscus isn't like anything we see alive today. It's why I find these kinds of weird wonders so fascinating.\"\"Some of the features that we might have assumed were present in the common ancestor of major animal groups, such as a post-anal tail, we found actually evolved independently. Cambrian fossils are fundamental to understanding these kinds of processes.\"                Rotadiscus is believed to be\u00a0a very early member of the ambulacrarians, a group that includes starfish and acorn worms. Credit: Li\u00a0et al             Why has it been difficult to describe Rotadiscus?Over half a billion years ago, the Cambrian period saw an extraordinary burst in evolution giving rise to an incredible diversity of life. Early members of many major animal groups alive today appeared during this time, including the chordates to which vertebrates belong.Many animals from this period possessed unique anatomies that look very different to anything seen today. But the patchiness of the fossil record often makes deciphering what these species are or where they fit into the tree of life challenging for paleontologists.In the past, Rotadiscus and its closest fossil relatives have been placed in a number of different groups, including the sea cucumbers and jellyfish. But the new fossils of Rotadiscus from Chengjiang are helping to clear this up.The Chengjiang biota is famous for its exceptionally preserved Cambrian fossils. The likely reason is that these animals were buried by a mudflow very rapidly while they were still alive, entombing them and preventing decay by bacteria and scavenging by other animals.The new Rotadiscus fossils are no exception, as their extraordinary preservation has revealed structures in more detail than had previously been observed, such as traces of possible nerves in the tentacles and a new double spiral structure.\"We weren't sure what type of animal Rotadiscus was, and that made it hard to use as a tool for understanding the diversity of life,\" says Imran.\"So our main goal in this paper was to figure out what Rotadiscus was and then uncover its evolutionary significance.\"      Why are these Rotadiscus fossils important?The exceptional preservation of the Rotadiscus specimens from the Chengjiang biota meant scientists could identify new features to help determine the evolutionary significance of the animal.Researchers analyzed 330 features from about 60 different groups of extinct and extant animals, looking for similarities that could suggest a link. Rotadiscus was determined to be a very early member of a group of animals called the ambulacrarians, which contains acorn worms and echinoderms like starfish and sea urchins.The new evolutionary tree including Rotadiscus and other fossils has helped the researchers reconstruct the evolution of major animal traits. One feature that was of particular significance was the presence of a tail extending posteriorly to the anus.Scientists originally believed that a post-anal tail was present in the common ancestor of all fish and acorn worms. However, as Rotadiscus lacks a post-anal tail it now seems that this trait may have evolved independently within these different groups.This process is known as convergent evolution, where the same feature evolves separately multiple times, often in response to similar environmental or ecological pressures.\"Through our analysis, we can fill an evolutionary gap with Rotadiscus and its relatives,\" says Imran. \"This is important because one of the goals for paleontologists is to try to understand the tree of life and how things are related to one another.\"\"But it's also exciting because it allows us to better understand the evolution of other major animal groups, including the one that includes humans. This also helps to reinforce the critical importance of fossils, as the predictions we made in this analysis could not have been made based on living animals alone.\"\"It's only by incorporating these unfathomable, weird wonders into our evolutionary trees that we can start to get a better understanding of the origin and early evolution of major animal groups.\" More information:Yujing Li et al, Cambrian stem-group ambulacrarians and the nature of the ancestral deuterostome, Current Biology (2023).

The only 15 remaining pairs of the charismatic birds on the island of Santa Cruz have produced 12 chicks this year, the park said.The species is endemic to the Galapagos, and is considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Darwin's flycatchers reside on other islands in the chain, like Pinzon, but their population was particularly threatened on Santa Cruz Island.An experimental management program there \"permitted 12 new chicks to add to the population\" in a forest at higher elevation on Santa Cruz, where only 15 pairs exist, the Galapagos National Park said.The reserve's director, Danny Rueda, said that \"each chick that is born is a new hope to save this species that is vulnerable and on the red list.\"\"These 12 new birds constitute a veritable success since initiating the program in 2018 and finally getting results, never more so than this year,\" the park said.The program, a joint project with the Charles Darwin Foundation, the University of Vienna and the nonprofit Galapagos Conservancy, has seen 21 chicks arrive on Santa Cruz between 2020 and 2022, it said.The Galapagos archipelago, some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off the coast of Ecuador, has flora and fauna found nowhere else in the world.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the fungus that has killed millions of bats across North America?",
    "text": "Deep in a cool, damp cave in Vermont, tens of thousands of furry, chocolate brown creatures stir.          The little brown bats, survivors of a deadly fungus that decimated their population, went into hibernation last fall. Now in early May, they're waking, detaching from their rock wall roosts and making their first tentative flights in search of the moths, beetles and flying aquatic insects they devour.It's here, in deep passages that creep into a Vermont mountain, where scientists found one of the first North American outbreaks of the fungus that causes white nose syndrome. Bat bones litter the cave floor like dry lawn-mower cuttings. Look closer and you'll find tiny skulls.And the bats are still dying.White nose syndrome is caused by an invasive fungus first found in an upstate New York cave in 2006, a short bat flight from the Dorset, Vermont, colony. The fungus wakes bats from hibernation, sending them into the frigid, winter air in search of food. They die of exposure or starvation because the insect population is too sparse to support them that time of year.Smaller than a mouse and about the weight of three pennies in the hand, the Dorset bats skitter across the cave walls or cling to one another for warmth. Their health hints that at least some species are adapting to the fungus that has killed millions of their brethren across North America.                Alyssa Bennett, small mammals biologist for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, points to a bat in a cave in Dorset, Vt., on May 2, 2023. Scientists studying bat species hit hard by the fungus that causes white nose syndrome, which has killed millions of bats across North America, say there is a glimmer of good news for the disease. Experts say more bats that hibernate at a cave in Vermont, the largest bat cave in New England, are tolerating the disease and passing protective traits on to their young. Credit: AP Photo/Hasan Jamali             \"That's really significant, because it seems to be a stronghold where these bats are mostly surviving and then spreading out throughout New England in the summer,\" said Alyssa Bennett, a small mammal biologist for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. She has studied bats and white nose syndrome for more than a decade.\"We're hoping that it's a source population for them to recover,\" Bennett said as critters flitted and swooped around her.It will take time. Little brown bat females birth only one pup a year. And while they can live into their teens or 20s, only 60% to 70% of pups make it beyond their first 12 months, Bennett said.Scientists now estimate that between 70,000 and 90,000 bats hibernate in the Dorset cave, the largest concentration in New England. Their numbers have dwindled from an estimated winter population of 300,000 to 350,000 or more in the 1960s, the last time the location was surveyed before white nose infiltrated.

Credit: AP Photo/Hasan Jamali             It's unclear how far the numbers dropped after the fungus set in, but biologists who visited in 2009 or 2010 noted the ground in front of the cave was carpeted with dead bats.The fungus that causes white nose syndrome is believed to have been brought to North America from Europe, where bats are apparently accustomed to it. Named for the white, fuzzy spots it produces on noses and other bat body parts, the fungus has killed 90% or more of the bat populations in parts of North America.Last month, a report by the North American Bat Conservation Alliance found that 81 of the 154 known bat species in the United States, Canada and Mexico are at severe risk from white nose infection, climate change and habitat loss.It matters. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that bats boost U.S. agriculture by $3.7 billion a year by eating crop-destroying insects such as larvae-laying moths, whose offspring bore into corn plants.

Credit: AP Photo/Hasan Jamali             Scientists have known for years that some little brown bats seemed to survive being exposed to the fungus, despite an overall mortality rate that was feared could eradicate them. Though Dorset's little brown bats are holding on, other once common species found with them, like northern long eared or tricolor bats, are almost impossible to detect there now, Bennett said.\"There's something special about those bats,\" Bennett said of Dorset's little browns. \"We can't tell exactly what that is, but we have genetic research that we've collaborated on that suggests those bats do have factors that are related to hibernation and immune response that are allowing them to tolerate this disease and pass those features on to their young.\"Winifred Frick, chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, who has followed white nose syndrome's march across North America, said the fungus has been found in 38 states so far. She says it's a \"gut punch\" each time she hears of a new outbreak.Colorado reported its first infected bats earlier this year.

Credit: AP Photo/Hasan Jamali             Frick is relieved that bats are beginning to repopulate some areas where carcasses once piled up, even if the rebound is so far only a fraction of earlier numbers.\"That's a real glimmer of hope,\" she said.In addition to Vermont, other areas near where white nose was first discovered also report stable, possibly rising numbers of little brown bats.Pennsylvania lost an estimated 99.9% of its population after white nose struck, said Greg Turner, the state mammal expert for the Pennsylvania Game Commission. While the numbers are still low, they're slowly increasing in some places. One old mine in Blair County had just seven bats in 2016. This year, there were more than 330.\"I'm feeling pretty comfortable,\" Turner said. \"We're not going to be stuck staring down the barrel of extinction.\"His research shows bats that hibernate at colder temperatures do better against white nose because the fungus grows more slowly.                Researchers shine light on clusters of bats roosting in a cave in Dorset, Vt., on May 2, 2023.

Credit: AP Photo/Hasan Jamali             That may mean the bats are less likely to wake up from the irritation it causes, though scientists still don't understand the mechanism that allows some animals to survive while so many succumb.\"By selecting colder temperatures, they're helping themselves in two ways, they're helping themselves preserve fat and preserve their energy and they're also getting less disease,\" Turner said.Still, there are worrying trends. Pennsylvania's bat population is a tiny fraction of what it was before white nose invaded. In some locations, Turner and his colleagues see more bats, but inexplicably few females.In Virginia, populations have plummeted more than 95%, though the state is starting to see some colonies stabilize or slightly grow their numbers. However, that's happening at only a fraction of the sites once monitored, said Rick Reynolds, a non-game mammal biologist with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.

Credit: AP Photo/Hasan Jamali                 \"We remain positive, but there is a long road ahead with much uncertainty,\" Reynolds said in an email.Back in Vermont, where temperatures in the Dorset cave fall into the low 40s (around 4.4 degrees Celsius) in winter, the bats seem to have found a sweet spot cold enough to slow growth of the fungus.Bennett is working with Laura Kloepper, a bioacoustics expert from the University of New Hampshire, to get a better handle on the population count. Using acoustic modeling, they're working to get a baseline population estimate this year by comparing sound recordings with thermal imaging. They'll survey using the same method again next year to try to determine the change.\"We want to try to understand what we can possibly do to save not only the species of bat, not only the bats at this cave, but really bats around the world,\" Kloepper said.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the University of Florida's equine program?",
    "text": "In the wild, horses must be alert for predators that might attack them. This means that even domesticated horses are hardwired to be aware of danger and can scare easily.          Unfortunately, this so-called \"startle response\" or \"spooking\" is reflexive, and horses often cannot distinguish between the danger a Florida panther might present versus a plastic bag floating by a riding arena. Some horses react to these perceived threats by rearing, bolting, or bucking, which can create dangerous situations for owners and riders.University of Florida researchers are working to identify genes that influence horses' tendency to react to these \"spooky\" plastic bags. Identifying these genetic traits would be a first step toward one day selecting or breeding horses for the temperament types we prefer. These research results might be a decade away.Samantha Brooks, UF/IFAS associate professor of equine genetics, and her team have run an experiment on several groups of young horses that are part of the UF/IFAS breeding program that helps understand startle responses.The horses wear wireless heart-rate monitors and are loose in a round pen. At set intervals, an umbrella is opened quickly within the animals' line of sight. The team analyzed the animals' behavior and change in heart rate throughout and after the initial startle reaction.\"We can't read their minds,\" said Brooks. \"Their heart rate tells us what is going on inside that we cannot see from reading their body language alone. It was interesting to see the stories their heart rates told us.\"Two clear groups of horses emerged from the data. The first group was startled by the umbrella opening, had a spike in heart rate, maintained a reactive or hyper-alert state including more time spent looking and moving away from the umbrella. The second group startled much like the first group to the umbrella opening, but with a different outcome.The horses experienced a spike in heart rate but then calmed quickly and carried on with their day. These animals perceived the stimulus and found it startling but did not to go through the behavioral patterns of avoidance, fear, etc. like the first group.      \"Horses have adapted over thousands of years to live with people,\" she said. \"Some of those changes include a reduction in startle response and are really helpful to better understand the horses we work with today.\"Now that two clear groups have emerged, the team will take this information and develop a study to differentiate the genetic components that make up how horses react to fear. Blood and hair samples were taken from each horse in the study for future analysis.Knowing how genetics weigh into behavior can help horses and owners find their right fit. Perhaps the spooky horse is not the best option for a 10-year-old 4-Her. But a spookier, high-strung horse might be a better fit for a high-energy \"job\" like show jumping.\"Understanding each horse's genetic makeup will help you understand the type of animal you need,\" said Brooks. \"If we learn early on what this animal's natural tendencies are most likely to be, we can make educated decisions on training and future careers to give the horse the best shot to grow into their potential, rather than becoming a problem or danger.\"Additionally, understanding a horse's reaction to uncomfortable situations can make a difference in how they are handled for medical procedures, transported and more.\"It's important to know these traits because it can impact how we care for horses overall,\" said Barclay Powell, a Ph.D. student working on the project. \"This will be hugely important to the veterinary field as well. It's not only helpful for the people handling the animals, but also for the horses' welfare.\"\"It doesn't matter if the horse is a racehorse, therapy animal or driving a carriage, an unplanned startle response is generally a problem,\" said Brooks. \"We are just beginning to scratch the surface of this. It might take us 10 years or more to really have a clear understanding, but it is worth the effort.\"\"This research provided graduate and undergraduate students an opportunity to see research in action and learn more about horse behavior,\" said Carissa Wickens, UF/IFAS associate professor and research partner. \"The students involved learned so much about conducting field-level behavioral testing and working with young horses. They enjoyed being part of the process, another exciting element of this project.\"The findings are published in the journal Genes. More information:Barclay B.

    "text": "Bacteria can rapidly evolve resistance to antibiotics by adapting special pumps to flush them out of their cells, according to new research from the Quadram Institute and University of East Anglia. The study is published in the journal npj Antimicrobials and Resistance.Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem of global significance. The rise of resistant \"superbugs\" threatens our ability to use antimicrobials like antibiotics to treat and prevent the spread of infections caused by microorganisms.It is hoped that the findings will improve how antibiotics are used to help prevent further spread of antimicrobial resistance.Prof Mark Webber UEA's Norwich Medical School, and the Quadram Institute, said, \"Knowing the details of the mechanisms bacteria develop to become resistant is a key step to understanding antimicrobial resistance. We hope that this kind of work to understand when and how resistance emerges can help us use antibiotics better to minimize selection of resistance.\"The team studied how exposure to antimicrobials leads to the emergence of resistance.Broadly, superbugs' defenses against antibiotics involve inactivating or evading drugs, stop them getting into their cells, or getting them out of their cells before they can have any effect. But exactly how they do this is still being worked out.In this new study Dr. Eleftheria Trampari from QI, Prof Webber, and colleagues recreated the evolutionary stresses that lead to antimicrobial resistance by exposing Salmonella bacteria to two different antibiotics.The bacteria were allowed to grow and reproduce in two different states that mimic how they live in the environment.Some were planktonic\u2014floating in a liquid broth\u2014but others were in biofilms. Bacteria form biofilms on surfaces, as a way of protecting themselves against stresses and most bacteria in the real world exist in a biofilm.Hundreds of generations of bacteria were grown and exposed to the antibiotics, and in this evolution simulation, survival of the fittest selected those bacteria best adapted to cope with the presence of the antibiotics.To identify how these \"winners\" had become resistant, the researchers sequenced the genomes of the resistant bacteria, to identify which genes had changed compared to their non-resistant ancestors.They found that both antibiotics selected different mutations in a molecular pump that Salmonella uses to get rid of toxic compounds from inside its cells. With colleagues from the University of Essex and University of Cagliari, they found that these two different changes altered how the pump worked in totally different ways. One made it easier for the pumps to catch drugs, the other made it easier for drugs to slide through the pump.A search of a databases of genomes of Salmonella isolates found that one of these mutations has also arisen multiple times in the real world, in Salmonella from patients, livestock and food in the UK, US and EU, as far back as 2003.The findings confirm a primary role for these pumps as the first line of defense against antimicrobials.\"This work simulates what happens in the real world where bacteria are constantly exposed to varying concentrations of antimicrobials,\" said Dr. Eleftheria Trampari from the Quadram Institute and first author on the study.\"Studying how resistant strains emerge and predict which drugs they will not respond to can be helpful in developing diagnostics and treatment strategies.\" More information:Eleftheria Trampari et al, Functionally distinct mutations within AcrB underpin antibiotic resistance in different lifestyles, npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the scientific name for the wasp that was discovered at the University of Minnesota?",
    "text": "Researchers at the University of Minnesota have discovered a new species of tiny parasitic wasp that might prove beneficial to managing soybean gall midge, a recently emerged pest in Midwest soybean fields that can have devastating impacts on plant production.          Their findings were recently published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.Since the appearance of the midge in 2018, growers have struggled to manage this insect, prompting researchers to seek effective and environmentally-friendly ways to help soybean farmers protect their crop. One approach is biological control, using natural enemies to kill pests. However, because soybean gall midge is new, very little is known about which species might prove to be good allies to growers in the fight against this damaging insect.Amelia Lindsey, an assistant professor in the Department of Entomology, and Robert Koch, an associate professor in the Department of Entomology and an Extension entomologist, led the team at the University of Minnesota. They focused on searching for parasitoids\u2014 insects that lay their eggs in or on another insect\u2014of soybean gall midge. Juveniles of the parasitoid develop inside the other insect, eventually killing them.To find such parasitic insects, a graduate student in the Lindsey and Koch labs, Gloria Melotto, collected soybean gall midge-infested plants from a Minnesota farm and waited to see which adult insects emerged from the plants.The researchers found:In addition to a lot of soybean gall midges, there were a number of tiny parasitoid wasps.In collaboration with two taxonomists who specialize in this group of insects\u2014Jessica Awad, doctoral researcher, State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, and Elijah Talamas, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services\u2014it became clear that there was no information on this wasp anywhere in the scientific record. It is a new-to-science species.The team used DNA sequencing data and physical characteristics of the wasps to formally describe the specimens and give them a scientific name: Synopeas maximum.The findings point toward this newly described parasitoid wasp species being a likely natural enemy of soybean gall midge.\"Unidentified and undescribed parasitoid micro-wasps are all around us. Although they are tiny, they play a huge role in regulating the populations of other insects, including pests. It's really exciting to discover a new parasitoid species in such an important crop system,\" said Awad.\"Effective management of soybean gall midge has proven challenging. Identification of a new species of parasitic wasp attacking this pest is an exciting breakthrough,\" said Koch.Ongoing work from the team includes a deeper dive into the biology of the wasp and the soybean gall midge to see how often this wasp attacks the pest, and how widespread this potential beneficial insect is across the midwest. Ultimately, the goal is to develop strategies for incorporating the natural enemy into management plans for safe and effective control of soybean gall midge infestations.

    "question_squad": " What is the most common crop grown on farmlands that the owner rented out?",
    "text": "Charles Towe, associate professor of agricultural and resource economics in the College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources, started noticing a change in land use in Columbia County, New York where his family farms.          Towe saw a lot of potential agricultural land in New York state going unused. He also personally knew farmers who couldn't find land in their area. This led him to explore this trend of decreased agricultural productivity.\"I was trying to solve the problem of, how do we have hundreds and hundreds of acres of land idle, and farmers looking for land saying, 'I can't find any land around',\" Towe says.Towe recently published his findings in Land Economics.He found that of the 800 agricultural parcels in Columbia County, an area near the Catskill Mountains, about a quarter were owned by non-residents. Of the non-residents\u2014people whose primary address is somewhere other than their property in Columbia County\u2014the most significant population came from New York City, which is about two hours away by car.While there may be non-resident owners from other areas, Towe focused his study on New Yorkers to understand their impact on land use in his community.\"It appears that there is a preference for the amenities that an ag parcel here provides for second homeowners coming out of the city,\" Towe says.Since 2001, nonresident ownership of farmland in Columbia County increased by 22.7%. Part of this upward trend may be related to the use value taxation credit New York state offers. The credit, which has existed for decades, allows property owners to receive a break on their property taxes if they use part of their land for agricultural purposes.However, there are few stipulations about what this use must look like. While the credit does benefit farmers, many non-resident owners use part of their land to produce low-value hay for animal bedding, but not a lot else. Others may rent out their land to local farmers as a way to receive the credit.Looking at two USDA databases on land use records from the past decade, Towe found that when non-residents buy agricultural land in this area, 10-11% of the land is removed from the agricultural sector altogether. An additional 10-11% is used for low-value hay.In 2019, Towe completed a similar study for the Connecticut Department of Agriculture to evaluate Connecticut's Public Act 490 which provides tax breaks for agricultural land. The Act was adopted in 1963 to help preserve the state's farm, forest, and open land.Just like in New York, Towe found that, by far, the most common crop grown on farmlands that the owner rented out was hay, around 40%.\"At the end of the day, if you want to buy land and use it in your way, that's your right,\" Towe says. \"But perhaps certain pro-agricultural tax policies should be revisited to verify that these are not being abused.\"Towe says this is the \"first log on the stack\" of uncovering the questions surrounding land use change with non-resident owners and the costs and benefits to the local community.\"There's a lot happening here that's kind of hard to put a finger on,\" Towe says.The next study Towe is conducting will look at data from short-terms vacation rentals in the area. Local attitudes often see these types of rentals as detrimental to the local community. But the full picture is likely more complicated as additional rental income makes more expensive homes more affordable to residents, and they bring tourist spending to the area.\"We're trying to make an economic link between the urban and rural communities because the country feels like it needs it,\" Towe says. \"I think the takeaway from this is we're really trying to say, \"What are the impacts, what are the positives and negatives of being in this second home market.'\" More information:The Impact of Recreational Homes on Agricultural Land Use Land Economics muse.jhu.edu/article/872445Provided byUniversity of ConnecticutCitation:Researcher explores impact of recreational homes on agricultural land use (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-explores-impact-recreational-homes-agricultural.html  This document is subject to copyright.

    "question_squad": " What is the goal of every dividing cell?",
    "text": "The goal of every dividing cell is to accurately segregate its genome into two genetically identical daughter cells. However, this process often goes awry and may be responsible for a new class of chromosomal abnormalities found in cancers and congenital disorders, UT Southwestern Medical Center scientists report in a new study. The discovery, published in Nature, sheds light on how cancer cells rapidly evolve genomic changes that fuel their proliferation.          \"Cancer genomes are remarkably complex. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of how diverse patterns of chromosomal alterations form and drive cancer development,\" said Peter Ly, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at UT Southwestern, who co-led the study with Yu-Fen Lin, Ph.D., Senior Research Scientist.The paper focuses on a process called chromothripsis, a term derived from Greek describing the catastrophic shattering of chromosomes into small fragments.In the study, Dr. Ly and colleagues in the Ly lab investigated how shattered chromosomes from abnormal structures called micronuclei move around during cell division. The researchers found that the chromosome fragments remained stuck together during cell division instead of dispersing throughout the cell. This allowed the shattered chromosome to segregate as a unit into one of the two daughter cells, where the cell's DNA repair machinery haphazardly stitched the pieces back together in the incorrect order to form a rearranged chromosome.The researchers identified a protein complex consisting of CIP2A and TOPBP1 that tethers the DNA fragments together during cell division. The genomic signatures of this process can be detected across 25 cancer types, resulting in the loss of critical tumor suppressor genes. These findings build upon previous work by Dr. Ly, who has engineered unique experimental systems to re-create and study chromothripsis in the laboratory.\"Since the discovery of chromothripsis in cancer genomes, it was puzzling to understand how fragments of a shattered chromosome could reassemble to generate scrambled chromosomes. We have now solved a key piece of that puzzle,\" said Dr. Ly, a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research.When the researchers prevented tethering by deleting the gene encoding for CIP2A or TOPBP1, the chromosome fragments scattered during cell division, causing them to accumulate throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm of both daughter cells, ultimately killing them.\"These findings suggest that chromosomally unstable and/or DNA repair-deficient tumors with micronuclei may be vulnerable to CIP2A inhibition,\" said Dr. Ly. His lab plans to continue studying the role of CIP2A-TOPBP1 in maintaining genome stability and whether this protein complex could be a relevant target for cancer treatment.Other UT Southwestern researchers who contributed to this study are Qing Hu, Ph.D., Alice Mazzagatti, Ph.D., and Rashmi Dahiya, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Fellows; and Elizabeth Maurais, Justin Engel, and Giaochau Nguyen, students in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

    "question_squad": " What is the second greatest threat to global biodiversity?",
    "text": "A multinational and interdisciplinary team of scientists has published new research that provides critical insights into the damage that the legal wildlife trade currently poses to global conservation and sustainability efforts. The group includes members of multiple International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission specialist groups who aim to highlight the risk posed by legal but unsustainable trade in thousands of species.          The study, published this month in the Journal of Environmental Management, involves a systematic review of existing tools, safeguards, and legal frameworks currently in place to ensure the sustainable use of live wild animals and their body parts.The researchers found that, for the vast majority of cases, the legal trade in wild animal species is not supported by any rigorous evidence of sustainability, with a lack of data on wildlife export volumes, wild animal population data, and evidence-based impact assessments of trade being of particular concern.\"Exploitation of wildlife represents one of the greatest threats to species survival. However, too often legal trade is automatically equated as being sustainable despite a lack of evidence needed to confirm that this is indeed the case,\" says Dr. Alice Hughes, Lead scientist, and Associate Professor at the University of Hong Kong.\"Our research sheds stark light on the systemic lack of regulatory safeguards that are urgently required to ensure that the legal trade does not drive wild population declines. While many wildlife focused conventions include claims of 'sustainable use' in reality these rarely refer to evidence or use precautionary principles to prevent further overexploitation of species.\"While much attention is being paid to combating illegal wildlife trade, many of the same challenges are also evident in the legal wildlife trade. The global legal wildlife trade is a big and burgeoning business estimated by some to be currently worth around 400 billion USD per year.The risks of unsustainable legal trade have been recognized and built upon by various United Nations conventions, which aim to reduce global biodiversity loss. However, the exploitation of wildlife is still considered to be the second greatest threat to global diversity and its vital contributions to people, right after climate change.Dr. Mark Auliya of the Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change in Bonn, Germany and contributing scientist, says, \"Our study provides evidence for 183 species showing unsustainable trade in a broad array of wildlife groups\u2014ranging from mammals like the mountain reedbuck for trophy hunting and handicraft products to invertebrates like the harlequin shrimp for the global exotic pet trade.\"      \"We found that the current legal trade was not supported by rigorous evidence of sustainability of these species examples with a lack of data on export levels and wild population monitoring data preventing any true assessments of sustainable use. These examples are only an indicative subset and should be considered as the tip of a larger iceberg. We expect that further scrutiny will reveal that far many more wildlife species are being exploited at unsustainable levels.\"The authors caution against the assumption that wildlife species can withstand high offtakes in the absence of data and underscores the need for appropriate application of the precautionary principle to prevent population declines and species extinctions, as well as to enable long-term economically viable wildlife trade. These species are crucial for ecosystem health. For the above reasons, monitoring of populations is essential to enable sustainable trade and not to jeopardize the provision of important ecosystem services.Dr. Vincent Nijman\u2014contributing scientist, and professor in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University in the UK\u2014says, \"Understanding what wild animals are being traded, where from, and at what volumes, in addition to the impact on the long-term viability of species, will be critical to slowing the loss of species from across the planet. In particular, a more precautionary approach is needed to halt biodiversity declines, underpinned by a revised burden of proof.\"\"This should place the need on traders and importers to illustrate sustainability to allow trading, not conservation scientists and practitioners to reveal unsustainability, or customs officers to prove export contravenes regulations.\"To help address the current situation, the scientists identify four core areas that should be strengthened to achieve this goal: (1) rigorous data collection and analyses of populations; (2) linking trade quotas to IUCN and international accords; (3) improved databases and compliance of trade; and (4) enhanced understanding of trade bans, market forces, and species substitutions.Professor David Edwards\u2014contributing scientist, and Professor of Conservation Science at the University of Sheffield, UK\u2014says, \"Creating awareness among decision makers of the lack of sustainability in much legal wildlife trade is urgently needed. Action is required to adapt relevant regulatory frameworks, like CITES, to ensure the continued survival of many threatened species.\"\"There are no winners from unsustainable wildlife collection and trade: without sustainable management not only will species or populations become extinct, but communities dependent upon these species will lose livelihoods.\" More information:Alice Hughes et al, Determining the sustainability of legal wildlife trade, Journal of Environmental Management (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the gene that is involved in malaria's resistance?",
    "text": "How malaria parasites evolved to evade a major antimalarial drug has long been thought to involve only one key gene. Now, thanks to a combination of field and lab studies, an international research team has shown a second key gene is also involved in malaria's resistance to the drug chloroquine.          The finding, published this week in the journal Nature Microbiology, has implications for the ongoing battle against malaria, which infects an estimated 247 million people and kills more than 619,000 annually\u2014mostly young children.\"With drug-resistant pathogens on the rise, it is important to understand how treatments drive parasite evolution and how this evolution can vary in different parts of the world,\" says Texas Biomedical Research Institute Professor Timothy J.C. Anderson, Ph.D., one of the lead authors of the paper.Chloroquine was developed to treat malaria in the 1950s and administered widely. Drug resistance emerged within a few years, spreading first through Southeast Asia and then through Africa in the 1970s and '80s. Chloroquine was replaced with a succession of other antimalarial drugs, but resistance evolution remains a challenge to control the parasites. In 2000, researchers identified a gene, the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), that evolved to help the parasites transport chloroquine out of a key region of their cells, rendering the drug ineffective.\"That resistance gene, pfcrt, is infamous,\" says University of Notre Dame Professor Michael Ferdig, Ph.D., and one of the lead paper authors. \"To find that pfcrt has a partner in crime should not be a surprise\u2014genes interact with each other as part of evolution all the time. But it was only with new tools and our integrated approach that we could finally pinpoint the specific culprit.\"Six species of malaria parasites infect humans; Plasmodium falciparum is considered the deadliest. In this paper, researchers from the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and collaborators analyzed more than 600 P. falciparum genomes collected in The Gambia from 1984 to 2014. The 30-year dataset revealed that mutations in a second gene encoding an amino acid transporter (AAT1) increased from 0% frequency in 1984 to 97% frequency in 2014.\"This is a very clear example of natural selection in action\u2014these mutations were preferred and passed on with extremely high frequency in a very short amount of time, suggesting they provide a significant survival advantage,\" says Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Professor Alfred Amambua-Ngwa, Ph.D., and one of the first authors. \"The mutations in AAT1 very closely mirror the increase of pfcrt mutations. Given this, it strongly suggests AAT1 is involved in chloroquine resistance.\"      Teams at Texas Biomed, University of Notre Dame and Seattle Children's Research Institute collaborated to evaluate experimentally how the mutations affect drug resistance. Specifically, researchers conducted genetic crosses between chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant parasites, which suggested involvement of AAT1 mutations. Using CRISPR gene-editing technology, researchers replaced the mutations in parasite genomes in the laboratory and observed this impacted drug resistance. Collaborators at Nottingham University tested the gene's function in yeast, which also showed that the mutations resulted in drug resistance. Collaborating institutes also included Wellcome Sanger Institute, Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit and UT Health San Antonio.\"This project would not have been possible without the dedication of multiple collaborators in the US, Europe, Asia and Africa,\" says Ashley Vaughan, Ph.D., principal investigator at Seattle Children's Research Institute, and one of the lead paper authors. \"We brought together very diverse methodologies, which all came to the same conclusion.\"But the team did not stop there. Additional malaria genome datasets showed that the AAT1 mutations that confer resistance disappeared in Africa once chloroquine was no longer used there, which is typically expected. However, it is a completely different story in Southeast Asia where the mutations remain.\"Our analyses showed that parasites from Africa and Asia carry different pfaat1 mutations, and our experimental data suggest that this may underlie the differences we observe in drug resistance evolution in Africa and Asia,\" says Dr. Ferdig.Remarkably, researchers analyzing different malaria species infecting rodents found the same gene to be involved in chloroquine resistance more than a decade ago. \"This shows me that the rodent and human malaria researchers need to be talking more,\" Dr. Anderson says.London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Professor David Conway, Ph.D., stresses that grappling with drug resistance\u2014for malaria and other pathogens\u2014requires taking a holistic approach to both drug development and pathogen surveillance. \"We must be aware that different genes and molecules will be working together to survive treatments,\" he says. \"That's why looking at whole genomes and whole populations is so critical.\" More information:Alfred Amambua-Ngwa et al, Chloroquine resistance evolution in Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by the putative amino acid transporter AAT1, Nature Microbiology (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the estimated amount of abandoned land around the world?",
    "text": "When people leave their rural lives behind to seek their fortunes in the city or agriculture is no longer profitable, the lands they toiled on are often left unused. A new perspective piece in Science shows that these abandoned lands could be both an opportunity and a threat for biodiversity, and highlights why abandoned lands are critical in the assessment of global restoration and conservation targets.          The past 50 years have seen an increased exodus of populations from rural to urban areas. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in or around cities and this proportion is expected to expand to up to 68% by 2050.There are of course a multitude of reasons for people to leave their rural lives behind and move to urban areas, including socioeconomic and political change, declining subsistence farming, and environmental factors. One effect of this continuous decrease in rural populations is that the land they leave behind leads to a rise in the number of abandoned fields and pastures, forestry areas, mines, factories, and even entire human settlements.IIASA researcher Gergana Daskalova and Johannes Kamp, a researcher at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, took a closer look at abandoned land\u2014in other words land on which human activities have ceased\u2014to explore how biodiversity is influenced, and what this means for ecology and conservation.\"The factors that drive depopulation and consequently also land abandonment are intensifying due to issues like climate change and the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, for example, has already created new abandonment hotspots. Abandonment is a globally important process. The scale at which this is happening around the world urged us to put the spotlight on the places people have left behind as a potential source of future solutions for conservation, while also protecting human livelihoods,\" Daskalova explains.According to the authors, the exact amount of abandoned land around the world is unknown, but it is estimated that it could comprise up to 400 million ha globally, which is an area roughly half the size of Australia. Most of this abandoned land is in the Northern Hemisphere, of which around 117 million ha falls within the former Soviet Union.                Houses and traditions washing away. Credit: Gergana Daskalova             The effect that abandoned areas have on biodiversity can be both positive and negative. The biggest wins are likely to be achieved where areas that were previously intensively farmed and where biodiversity was low, are abandoned. The first changes that will probably be observed in these areas would be the return of plant life, birds, and invertebrates that can survive in recently disturbed ecosystems.If the abandonment of these crop fields is coupled with people leaving the area or with wildlife reintroductions, this can lead to rewilding with the possible return of large herbivores and even carnivores. The authors however point out that not all abandoned land will recover without help, and that some of the land that was previously intensively farmed will never return to what it once was.Land abandonment can also have negative impacts in terms of biodiversity, as well as for human culture and tradition. In areas that have traditionally been used for low-intensity, or subsistence farming over a long period of time, for instance, the close ties between the people and the land have created interdependent ecosystems that break down after people move away, thus leading to the loss of locally rare species or the proliferation of only one or two dominant species at the expense of others.\"Because abandonment usually happens out of sight, there is still so much we do not know about its imprint on the planet. We are currently working in Bulgaria, the quickest depopulating country in the world, to determine what types of plants, birds, and other biodiversity return to villages long after the last house lights have been turned off,\" Daskalova notes.Any gains in biodiversity on abandoned land can unfortunately be very quickly undone when land is recultivated or repurposed and, according to the authors, there is growing pressure to find new industrial uses for abandoned land, such as large-scale bioenergy, wind-, and solar energy production, often in just over a decade after abandonment.The authors further highlight that finding the best use for abandoned land will involve balancing benefits for conservation, human livelihoods, and sustainability. It is therefore crucial that biodiversity change on abandoned land be included in regional and global assessments, policies, and scenarios and where abandoned land is reused, care should be taken to ensure that economic needs are balanced with restoration and conservation goals.\"It is important for future models and scenarios aimed at predicting the positive versus negative effects of abandonment on biodiversity to take into account whether the land is likely to remain abandoned and what the feedbacks between abandonment, biodiversity, human values, and livelihoods entail. As global conversations around this topic continue, we can look to abandoned lands as the product of centuries of interactions between people and nature, and create incentives not just for conservation, but also for land stewardship and the preservation of both social and ecological values,\" Daskalova concludes.

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the cornerstone policy protecting fisheries in the US?",
    "text": "Commercial fishing employs 1.2 million Americans and generates more than $165 billion annually. Yet warming waters are threatening fish populations and disrupting fisheries around the world\u2014a challenge set to worsen as climate change advances.          Despite the importance of sustaining fisheries, the reauthorization of the cornerstone policy protecting them in the United States\u2014the Magnuson-Stevens Act\u2014has been stalled in Congress for a decade. The holdup? Some blame the policy for being too stringent and leading to what they call \"underfishing,\" while others argue the policy is not doing enough to rebuild depleted fish populations. Others go so far as to argue that fish populations would have rebounded without any policy.A pair of studies finds these concerns to be largely unsubstantiated. In analyzing the policy's impact on fish populations, fishing, and industry revenue, they find that it is working essentially as it should. It is rebuilding fish populations, and in most cases it is not unduly holding back fishers from making their catch.\"Many people talk about the need to manage our resources sustainably,\" says Eyal Frank, a lead author of the studies and an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. \"Too often, this becomes just talk with little evidence that our policies are making a difference. Our studies provide that evidence. Our fishing policy is working, and that is very encouraging news at a time when sustaining our fisheries couldn't be more vital.\"Kimberly Oremus, co-lead author of the studies and an assistant professor at the University of Delaware's School of Marine Science and Policy, adds, \"With many of the world's fisheries in decline, our findings show that sustainable fishing is possible with the right policies.\"In their study published in Science, Frank, Oremus and their other co-authors first examine the assertion of critics of U.S. fishing policy that it is too stringent and unnecessarily leaving too many fish in the water. They find that the main reason about half of the fish stocks considered \"underfished\" in this way is due to pure economics.Fishers are not harvesting the fish because there is not enough demand for them. Other healthy fish stocks are being left in the water because they could not be profitably caught without also catching other fish species that are depleted. Just four fish species make up the majority of the revenue of those \"underfished.\" And, of those, the majority of the revenue came from just one species: the walleye pollock, the catch of which is not constrained by our federal fisheries law.      \"If the concern is lost revenue or catch, it would make the most sense to narrow the focus to this small number of high-value stocks, which are constrained for specific reasons that may or may not prove tractable,\" the researchers write.In a second study, Frank and Oremus look at a separate criticism of the policy: that it is not doing enough to rebuild fish populations or that fish populations would have rebounded on their own without the policy. They discover the opposite to be true. Fish subject to the policy saw their size increase to be 52.2% larger than those comparable fish in the European Union, where similar fishing policies were not yet in effect.Comparing U.S. fish populations that were depleted before the rebuilding policy went into effect to U.S. fish populations that were depleted after the policy went into effect, Frank and Oremus find that in the absence of policy the declining fish populations continued to decline by about 45%. But when the policy took effect, it took five to 10 years for the fish population to double in size\u2014recovering to be about 98% greater in size than when it was first threatened.Frank and Oremus show that the policy clearly leads to long-term gains in the fish population. But how does it impact the industry? The researchers find that the fish catch and revenue declined in the first years of rebuilding, but then recovered to pre-rebuilding levels or higher within a decade. In fact, the authors report results that suggest that in the 10 to 15 years after being subject to the rebuilding efforts, the size of the catch for fish populations that had fully recovered was 51.9% higher than that of equivalent fish stocks in the EU.\"We hope these studies provide useful evidence for policymakers that science-based management of biological resources actually works,\" Oremus says.

    "text": "Coral reef fish larvae undergo major physiological changes during their short development as they transition from long-distance dispersal in the open ocean to settling on a reef, according to a study by Adam Downie at James Cook University in Australia and colleagues, published May 11 in the open access journal PLOS Biology.          Coral reef fish tend to stay in the reef as adults, but when they spawn their eggs are washed into the open ocean. After hatching, the larvae swim against strong currents to settle on a reef, an energetically demanding task. Once settled on the reef floor, they must survive low-oxygen (hypoxic) environments at night. To understand how fish larvae cope with these two opposing challenges, the researchers collected daily measurements of swimming speed, oxygen uptake, and hypoxia tolerance in cinnamon anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus) larvae in the laboratory from hatching until day nine, when they usually settle.They found swimming speed increased from three body-lengths per second at hatching to ten body-lengths per second by day nine. Oxygen uptake rates decreased, and hypoxia tolerance increased around day five. The team sequenced mRNA from larvae of different ages to investigate changes in gene activity changes during development. Physiological changes were correlated with the production of different hemoglobin subunits. Activity of 2,470 genes changed during development, with the biggest shift between four and nine after hatching. This included increased expression of the oxygen-carrying molecules myoglobin, cytoglobin, and neuroglobin.Relative to their body size, cinnamon anemonefish larvae have the highest oxygen uptake rate of any bony fish measured to date, which underpins their exceptional swimming performance. The authors suggest that changes in gene activity allow the larvae to switch from hemoglobin subunits that deliver large amounts of oxygen to tissues for swimming, to different subunits that help them cope with hypoxic conditions on the reef floor.Downie adds, \"Anemonefishes are miniature athletes as larvae so they are able to swim against ocean currents and find a home coral reef to settle on. When they are close to finding a reef, they lower their oxygen uptake rates and their hemoglobin changes to be able to tolerate the low oxygen levels that characterize their new coral reef homes at night.\" More information:Rapid physiological and transcriptomic changes associated with oxygen delivery in larval anemonefish suggest a role in adaptation to life on hypoxic coral reefs, PLOS Biology (2023).

    "text": "A new study published in the journal Science by an international team finds that early human species adapted to mosaic landscapes and diverse food resources, which would have increased our ancestor's resilience to past shifts in climate.          Our genus Homo evolved over the past 3 million years\u2014a period of increasing warm/cold climate fluctuations. How early human species have adapted to the intensification of climate extremes, ice ages, and large-scale shifts in landscapes and vegetation remains elusive. Did our ancestors adjust to local environmental changes over time, or did they seek out more stable environments with diverse food resources? Was our human evolution influenced more by temporal changes in climate, or by the spatial character of the environment?To test these fundamental hypotheses on human evolution and adaptation quantitively, the research team used a compilation of more than three thousand well-dated human fossil specimens and archaeological sites, representing six different human species, in combination with realistic climate and vegetation model simulations, covering the past 3 million years. The scientists focused their analysis on biomes\u2014geographic regions which are characterized by similar climates, plants, and animal communities (e.g., savannah, rainforest, or tundra).\"For the archaeological and anthropological sites and corresponding ages, we extracted the local biome types from our climate-driven vegetation model. This revealed which biomes were favored by the extinct hominin species H. ergaster, H. habilis, H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, and H. neanderthalensis and by our direct ancestors\u2014H. sapiens,\" said Elke Zeller, Ph.D. student from the IBS Center for Climate Physics at Pusan National University, South Korea, and lead author of the study.                Timeline of hominin evolution and adaptation to various vegetation types. According to the new Science study, adaptation played a key role in the geographic expansion of our genus Homo.

Science 2020.             According to their analysis, the scientists found that earlier African groups preferred to live in open environments, such as grassland and dry shrubland. Migrating into Eurasia around 1.8 million years ago, hominins, such as H. erectus and later H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis developed higher tolerances to other biomes over time, including temperate and boreal forests.      \"To survive as forest-dwellers, these groups developed more advanced stone tools and likely also social skills,\" said Prof. Pasquale Raia, from the Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Italy, co-author of the study. Eventually, H. sapiens emerged around 200,000 years ago in Africa, quickly becoming the master of all trades. Mobile, flexible, and competitive, our direct ancestors, unlike any other species before, survived in harsh environments such as deserts and tundra.When further looking into the preferred landscape characteristics, the scientists found a significant clustering of early human occupation sites in regions with increased biome diversity. \"What that means is that our human ancestors had a liking for mosaic landscapes, with a great variety of plant and animal resources in close proximity,\" said Prof. Axel Timmermann, co-author of the study and Director of the IBS Center for Climate Physics in South Korea. The results indicate that ecosystem diversity played a key role in human evolution.The authors demonstrated this preference for mosaic landscapes for the first time on continental scales and propose a new Diversity Selection Hypothesis: Homo species, and H. sapiens, in particular, were uniquely equipped to exploit heterogeneous biomes.\"Our analysis shows the crucial importance of landscape and plant diversity as a selective element for humans and as a potential driver for socio-cultural developments,\" adds Elke Zeller. Elucidating how vegetation shifts have shaped human sustenance, the new Science study provides an unprecedented view into human prehistory and survival strategies.The climate and vegetation model simulations, which cover the Earth's history of the past 3 million years, were conducted on one of South Korea's fastest science supercomputers named Aleph. \"Supercomputing is now emerging as a key tool in evolutionary biology and anthropology,\" said Axel Timmermann.

    "text": "Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that can infect the large intestine, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening colon damage. A study published May 11 in PLOS Biology by Ophelia Venturelli at University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S., and colleagues suggests that between-species interactions within the gut microbiome may impact the efficacy of antibiotics aimed at treating C. difficile infections.          C. difficile infections occur in the context of complex resident gut communities. However, antibiotic treatments aimed at eliminating the bacterium are designed based on C. difficile's measured susceptibility to drugs in monoculture without considering its interactions with other bacteria.In order to better understand susceptibility-altering microbial interactions across different microbial communities, researchers performed experiments to test the effectiveness of two antibiotics used to treat C. difficile infections, vancomycin and metronidazole, in a diverse human gut community. To identify the ecological principles underlying the interspecies interactions, they built a computational model to understand the interplay of microbial interactions and antibiotics on C. difficile growth.The researchers found that bacterial species that are more susceptible to the tested antibiotics than C. difficile allow C. difficile to grow in the absence of ecological competition, and increase the abundance of C. difficile in the presence of sub-lethal concentrations of metronidazole. The authors also found that the presence of a specific bacterial species makes C. difficile tolerant to metronidazole. The study was limited to only two antibiotics, so future research should prioritize how interspecies interactions may affect the efficacy of other clinically relevant drugs.According to the authors, \"These results provide key insights into ecological principles and molecular mechanisms influencing antibiotic susceptibility in this health-relevant system. Our work demonstrates that pathogen growth can be altered by inter-species interactions across a wide range of antibiotic concentrations, which should be considered in the design of antibiotic treatments.\"Venturelli adds, \"The human gut pathogen Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is embedded in a dense and diverse human gut community that influences its colonization ability, growth and functions. Using a bottom-up community assembly approach, we demonstrate that C. difficile's response to clinically relevant antibiotics can be altered by an antibiotic-induced reduction in the strength of bacterial competition or global shifts in C. difficile's cellular state in the presence of the commensal gut species Desulfovibrio piger.\" More information:Venturelli OS (2023) Gut microbiota interspecies interactions shape the response of Clostridioides difficile to clinically relevant antibiotics, PLOS Biology (2023).

    "question_squad": " What is the name of the crustacean that was used as a model organism?",
    "text": "Scientists at UMass Chan Medical School and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole have identified the first gene\u2014Bmal1\u2014to play a crucial role in regulating circatidal behavior in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. Circatidal rhythms help animals cope with the rise and fall of the tides in coastal areas.          Published in Current Biology, the study by neurobiologists Patrick Emery, Ph.D., Joshua Rosenthal, Ph.D., and colleagues demonstrates the first molecular link between circatidal and circadian clocks, while establishing P. hawaiensis as a powerful new animal system for studying the genetics underlying circatidal rhythms.\"Biological clocks are critical for organisms\u2014including humans\u2014to optimize their physiology and adapt their behavior to environmental cycles,\" said Dr. Emery, vice chair and professor of neurobiology at UMass Chan Medical School and a Marine Biological Laboratory Whitman Center investigator. \"By understanding how these behaviors are genetically hardwired into organisms, we can map the sensory systems and neural circuits that impact physiology and behavior.\"Tides occur every 12.4 hours. One of the two daily tides is caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the Earth, while the second results from the centrifugal force created by the moon and Earth's rotational movements in space. Marine animals that live in tidal areas have adapted behaviors to contend with these dramatic shifts from dry to aquatic environments every 12.4 hours.Though circatidal rhythms were first observed in the early 20th century in the Roscoff worm (Symsagittifera roscoffensis) and studied in detail in crabs, mussels and other marine species since the 1950s, the molecular and genetic underpinnings of the circatidal clock, as well as its relationship to the circadian clock, has remained elusive.\"The lack of an animal model amendable to genetic knockdown and transgenic manipulations has prevented scientists from definitively investigating the molecular origins of the circatidal clock and its relation to circadian clock genes,\" said Emery. \"Only a handful of studies about circatidal genetics exist and these are unable to either rule in or rule out a role for circadian clock genes in circatidal behaviors in animals.\"      Erica Kwiatkowski, an MD/Ph.D. student in the Emery lab at UMass Chan, in collaboration with the lab of Dr. Rosenthal, senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory, identified the small amphipod crustacean P. hawaiensis as a promising model. To simulate P. hawaiensis' natural environment, the researchers developed an artificial tidal habitat in the lab for the one-centimeter-long animal using artificial seawater that was pumped in and out of an aquarium every 12.4 hours.Kwiatkowski and colleagues exposed the amphipods to 10 cycles (the equivalent of five days) in the artificial tidal environment. Once acclimated to these conditions, P. hawaiensis was removed by the researchers from the artificial tidal environment and placed into a habitat with a constant water level. While in individual test tubes, the animals' swimming activity was recorded using infrared beams. Strikingly, every 12.4 hours, the majority of the animals (80 percent) increased their swimming activity in anticipation of high tides and then reduced activity in anticipation of low tide, even though they no longer were exposed to changing water levels. This demonstrated the existence of a circatidal clock controlling locomotor behavior in P. hawaiensis.The lab of Marine Biological Laboratory director, Nipam Patel, Ph.D., has developed P. hawaiensis as a model organism for studying genes controlling numerous aspects of embryo development, including limb patterning.\"Over the years, the Patel lab created valuable resources in this organism, such as a sequenced genome and methods to knock-out genes using CRISPR. Although the original intention wasn't to use Parhyale for the study of circatidal rhythms, it has turned out to be excellent for this purpose. We predict that this organism will catalyze a lot of future research in this area,\" Rosenthal said.Once the strong presence of a circatidal rhythm in P. hawaiensis was established, Kwiatkowski and colleagues used CRISPR/Cas9-guided gene knockdown to hunt for genes connected to the circatidal behavior. By knocking down individual genes, scientists can observe the effect that a lost gene has on a biological process.Using the genes that control circadian rhythms in mammals as a guide to looking for circatidal genes, Kwiatkowski and colleagues found that knocking down the circadian gene Bmal1 changed P. hawaiensis behavior\u2014the animal no longer exhibited circatidal swimming behaviors. Instead, the animals exhibited arhythmic behavior unconnected to tidal flows.\"Bmal1 is a critical component for the maintenance of circatidal behavior in P. hawaiensis,\" said Kwiatkowski. \"This is the first evidence that a gene involved in circadian rhythms is also involved in circatidal rhythms. This establishes a molecular link between the two systems.\"The next step for Emery and colleagues is to investigate the exact role Bmal1 plays in driving circatidal behavior and which other genes may be involved.
